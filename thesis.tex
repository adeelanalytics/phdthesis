\chapter{Introduction}

\lettrine{L}{earning} from experience in order to change behavior is one of the defining abilities of biological systems, which differentiates them from other kinds of systems found in the world.
Replicating the processes biological systems use to learn and adapt is a fundamental goal of science and technology.
The development of mathematical formalisms rich enough to capture the notion of learning is one of the crowning achievements of statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

One such formalism is the \emph{Bayesian} view of learning.
In this framework, one starts with (i) a probability distribution describing the information known about the quantity of interest external to the data, and (ii) a conditional probability distribution describing how the quantity of interest relates to the data.
These are combined into a joint distribution and conditioned on the specific observed data values, giving a probability distribution describing what was learned about the quantity of interest by observing the data.

The Bayesian view of learning gives rise to a theory of \emph{decision}, which describes how an abstract decision system should select actions in pursuit of a goal.
This is done by learning how different actions affect pursuit of the goal, and selecting optimal actions consistent with what was learned.
By virtue of being probabilistic, such decisions systems assess and propagate uncertainty, enabling them to balance what is already known with what could be learned by taking actions---a concept known as the \emph{explore-exploit tradeoff}.

The performance of a decision system can be evaluated by examining how quickly its decisions improve and become optimal.
A decision system's \emph{regret} is the reduction in its quality of decisions by virtue of not knowing the quantity of interest in advance.
In most non-trivial settings, one can show that some regret is inevitable: a decision-making system must make some degree of mistakes in order to learn.
A decision system is considered \emph{optimal} if its regret is within a constant factor of the best possible regret.

Decisions systems with optimal or close-to-optimal regret require less data in order to solve their respective tasks, and are called \emph{data-efficient}.
Data-efficiency is a key concern in practical settings, where data-collection takes time and can be expensive.
By virtue of resolving explore-exploit tradeoffs in a manner amenable to regret analysis, the Bayesian formalism gives broad tools for constructing data-efficient decision systems.

The key limitation of the Bayesian approach is that it is often \emph{too powerful}, and leads to computational problems which are intractable.
Conditional distributions generally contain more information than actually needed to make optimal decisions, yet calculating them is largely unavoidable.
Probabilistic decision systems are thus most attractive settings where their strengths---including data-efficiency, solid technical foundations, and amenability to analysis---can shine, while computational costs are kept under control.

In my view, \emph{Gaussian processes} are one such setting: they are powerful enough to model wide classes of unknown quantities of interest, yet their computational costs are generally polynomial.
Better yet, Gaussian-process-based decision systems have been demonstrated to exhibit excellent performance in a number of practical settings, including ones deployed in real-world commercial applications.
Studying Gaussian processes is therefore a promising avenue towards improved understanding of Bayesian learning and Bayesian decision-making in pursuit of artificial intelligence.

The goals of this dissertation are twofold: (i) to make Gaussian processes easier to work with through improved numerical methods, particularly in cases where they are used within larger decision systems, and (ii) to expand the set of settings where Gaussian processes can be practically employed in, enabling construction of decision systems for applications not previously considered.
Contributions toward (i) include path-wise conditioning techniques studied in Chapter \ref{ch:pathwise}, and contributions toward (ii) include non-Euclidean Gaussian processes studied in Chapter \ref{ch:noneuclidean}.
Following these, Chapter \ref{ch:conclusion} concludes.

To pursue these goals, it is critically important that all of the ideas described in the preceding paragraphs be made into rigorous mathematics, so that the ideas described in the sequel ultimately reduce to definitions and implications, and not metaphor or opinion.
Together, we will therefore begin by defining the key mathematical notions needed, beginning with the learning framework within which we will work.

\subsection*{Mathematical preliminaries}
We will work within the language of measure-theoretic probability, which we now recall.
To ease presentation, we state the definitions together with useful ways of thinking about them.

We say that \emph{measurable space} a pair $(Y,\c{Y})$ consisting of a set $Y$ and a $\sigma$-algebra $\c{Y}$ over $Y$.
A $\sigma$-algebra is a set of subsets of $Y$ containing the space itself and closed under unions, intersections, complements, and set-theoretic monotone limits.
These can be reinterpreted as Boolean logical operations, so $\c{Y}$ can be thought of as the set of all true-false questions one can ask about elements of the set $Y$. 
These questions, then, are closed under \emph{and/or/not} operations and limits thereof.

A map $f : X \-> Y$ between measurable spaces $(X,\c{X})$ and $(Y,\c{Y})$ is said to be \emph{measurable} if its preimage defines a map $f^{-1} : \c{Y} \-> \c{X}$ between the respective $\sigma$-algebras.
This means that true-false questions for the space $Y$ can be asked and answered relative to true-false questions for the space $X$.

A \emph{probability measure} is a countably additive map $\pi_y : \c{Y} \-> [0,1]$ satisfying $\pi_Y(Y) = 1$. 
This can be thought of as a map that takes a true/false question, and assigns a number indicating how close to true or false its answer is according to the measure---in this view, probability measures describe uncertainty.
A \emph{probability space} is a measurable space equipped with a probability measure.
The set $\Omega$ can be viewed as a space of abstract random numbers, with a random number generator described by the measure $\P$.

Let $(\Omega,\c{F},\P)$ be a probability space, and let $Y$ be a measurable space.
We say that a \emph{random variable} is measurable map $y : \Omega \-> Y$.
A random variable, then, maps random numbers $\omega\in\Omega$ into the space $Y$.
The \emph{distribution} of a random variable is defined as the \emph{pushforward measure} $\pi_y(A_y) = (y_* \P)(A_y) = \P(y^{-1}(A_y))$ for all $A_y\in\c{Y}$.
The probability of an event $A_y$, then, is determined by measuring the probability of random numbers under which $A_y$ occurs---measurability guarantees this is possible.

In this work, we will \emph{not} adopt the standard convention of suppressing $\omega$-arguments of random variables from our notation, and will write such arguments explicitly.
Though this makes expressions slightly denser, it also avoids ambiguity and presents the mathematics more precisely.

We will be interested in probability measures extended to allow them to be parameterized by other quantities.
A \emph{probability kernel} is defined to be a map $\pi_{y\given\theta} : \c{Y} \x \Theta \-> [0,1]$ satisfying two conditions: (i) the map $\pi_{y\given\theta}(\.,\vartheta) : \c{Y} \-> [0,1]$ is a probability measure for almost all $\vartheta\in\Theta$, and (ii) the map $\pi_{y\given\theta}(A_y,\.) : \Theta \-> [0,1]$ is measurable for all $A_y\in\c{Y}$.

Random variables can also be extended to parameterize them by other quantities.
We say that a jointly measurable map $y\given\theta : \Omega \x \Theta \-> Y$ is a \emph{jointly measurable stochastic process}, though we mostly eschew this terminology to emphasize the Bayesian nature of our formalism.
Define the \emph{conditional distribution} of $y\given\theta$ to be $(y\given\theta)_*\P$, where the pushforward is taken in the first argument---by Lemma \ref{lem:rcrv-rvm-equiv}, this is seen to be a probability kernel.



\section{Bayesian learning}

The key idea behind Bayesian learning is to define \emph{learning} using \emph{conditional probability}.
Building a model therefore entails quantifying the relationship between the \emph{quantity of interest} $\theta$, and the \emph{data} $y$.
This is done as follows.

\begin{definition}[Bayesian model]
Let $Y$ and $\Theta$ be sets.
A \emph{Bayesian model} is a probability measure defined on $\Theta \x Y$.
\end{definition}

A model can be constructed in a number of different ways.
The most common technique is to specify two components: (i) a probability distribution describing what is known about the quantity of interest external to the data, and (ii) how the data relates to the quantity of interest.
These are called the \emph{prior distribution} and \emph{likelihood}, respectively.

\begin{proposition}
A Bayesian model can be constructed in the following ways.
\1 Using measures: integrate the following two components.
\1 \emph{Prior}: a probability measure $\pi_\theta$.
\2 \emph{Likelihood}: a probability kernel $\pi_{y\given\theta}$.
\0 
\2 Using random variables: compose the following two components.
\1 \emph{Prior}: a random variable $\theta:\Omega\->\Theta$.
\2 \emph{Likelihood}: a jointly measurable stochastic process $y\given\theta: \Omega\x\Theta\->Y$.
\0 
\0 
Moreover, if $y\given\theta$ additionally satisfies the \emph{non-duplicate dependence} condition---namely, that for almost every $\theta'\in\Theta$, the random variable $(y\given\theta)(\.,\theta') : \Omega \-> Y$ is independent of $\theta$---then the constructions coincide.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
For the former, define 
\[
\pi_{\theta,y}(A_\theta\x A_y) = \int_{A_\theta} \pi_{y\given\theta}(A_y\given\theta) \d\pi_\theta(\theta)
\]
which extends to the full product $\sigma$-algebra by Lemma \ref{lem:cyl-prod}, giving the desired probability measure.
For the latter, define the random variable
\[
\gamma : \Omega &\-> \Theta \x Y
&
\gamma : \omega &\|> (\theta(\omega), (y\given\theta)(\omega,\theta(\omega)))
\]
and take $\pi_{\theta,y} = \gamma_* \P$. 
We now prove these expressions coincide.
Write 
\[
\pi_{\theta,y}(A_\theta\x A_y) &= \int_{A_\theta} \pi_{y\given\theta}(A_y\given\theta) \d\pi_\theta(\theta)
\\
&= \int_\Omega\1_{\theta(\omega)\in A_\theta} \pi_{y\given\theta}(A_y\given\theta(\omega)) \d\bb{P}(\omega)
\\
&= \int_\Omega\1_{\theta(\omega)\in A_\theta} \int_\Omega \1_{(y\given\theta)(\omega',\theta(\omega)) \in A_y} \d\bb{P}(\omega') \d\bb{P}(\omega)
\\
&= \int_{\Omega\x\Omega} \1_{(\theta(\omega),(y\given\theta)(\omega',\theta(\omega))) \in A_\theta \x A_y} \d\bb{P}^2(\omega,\omega')
\\
&= \int_\Omega \1_{(\theta(\omega),(y\given\theta)(\omega,\theta(\omega))) \in A_\theta \x A_y}\d\bb{P}(\omega)
\\
&= \P((\theta,(y\given\theta)(\.,\theta)) \in A_\theta \x A_y)
\]
which follows using Tonelli's Theorem, Lemma \ref{lem:cyl-prod}, and Lemma \ref{lem:non-dupl-dep} via the non-duplicate dependence condition.
\end{proof}

These two components should be interpreted as follows: $\theta$ describes what is known about the quantity of interest external to the data, and $y\given\theta$ describes how the data $y$ relates to the quantity of interest.
More specifically, the likelihood describes how $y$ would be distributed if $\theta$ was known and equal to the conditioned value.

Given a Bayesian model, we can formalize the notion of what is \emph{learned} about $\theta$ from observing $y$ as its conditional probability distribution---note that this is meant in a \emph{distributional} sense, not a random-variable-based sense.
The formulation is given as follows.

\begin{result}[Bayes' Rule]
Suppose that $\Theta$ and $Y$ are second-countable topological spaces, and let $\pi_y = \pi_{\theta,y}(\Theta\x\.)$.
Then for every Bayesian model $\pi_{\theta,y}$ there is a $\pi_y\ae[-]$ unique probability kernel $\pi_{\theta\given y}$, which we call the \emph{posterior distribution}.
\end{result}

\begin{proof}
Apply the Disintegration Theorem.
\end{proof}

This result shows that given a Bayesian model, the posterior distribution \emph{exists}.
In its full abstract formulation, however, Bayes' Rule is \emph{non-constructive}, and it is not at all clear how to calculate any kind of useful formula from it.
Fortunately, in many settings this is possible by virtue of additional structure.

The simplest such structure occurs when $\pi_{\theta,y}$ admits a density with respect to a reference measure $\lambda$.
In this case, it follows Lemma \ref{lem:prod-density} that $\pi_\theta$ admits the density $f_\theta$ with respect to $\lambda(\.\x Y)$, and similarly for $\pi_y$ and $f_y$.
Define a \emph{conditional density} as the ratio of joint and marginal densities, and let $\propto$ denote equality up to a proportionality constant.
Then we have the following.

\begin{proposition}[Bayes' Rule for densities]
Suppose that $\pi_{\theta,y}$ admits the density $f_{\theta,y}$ with respect to $\lambda_{\theta,y}$.
Then we have
\[
f_{\theta\given y} \propto f_{y\given\theta}f_\theta
.
\]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
We have
\[
f_{\theta,y} &= \frac{f_{\theta,y}}{f_\theta} f_\theta = f_{y\given\theta}f_\theta
&
f_{\theta,y} &= \frac{f_{\theta,y}}{f_y} f_y = f_{\theta\given y}f_y
\]
which, when combined, give the result.
\end{proof}

Sometimes, the knowledge of $f(\theta\given y)$ up to proportionality is enough to fully deduce its form.
For example, if the likelihood is Gaussian with unknown mean and known variance, and the prior is also Gaussian, then the posterior is Gaussian.
In cases such as this, the pair $(\pi_{y\given\theta}, \pi_\theta)$ are called \emph{conjugate}.

Bayes' Rule for densities is remarkable in its generality yet restrictiveness.
On one hand, we require no direct assumptions about the spaces $\Theta$ and $Y$, and in particular allow real spaces, discrete spaces, and Riemannian manifolds.
On the other hand, other than in the aforementioned settings, where we can employ the Lebesgue, counting, and Riemannian volume measures, respectively, finding a suitable reference measure can be difficult.

We will work with posterior distributions in infinite-dimensional vector spaces in the sequel---there, densities are either not available or not convenient.
In those cases, it is enough to calculate the posterior on arbitrary finite-dimensional marginal projections to uniquely determine its value on the full infinite-dimensional space.

\begin{proposition}[Conditioning and marginalization]
Conditioning and marginalization commute.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
TODO.
\end{proof}

This result makes densities into a substantially more powerful tool than they would be otherwise, since it enables us to use them for calculating posterior distributions even where they are not directly available.
In particular, we can map an infinite-dimensional function space into finite-dimensional vector spaces induced by pointwise function evaluations at arbitrary points, enabling us to calculate posterior distributions in such settings, in spite of no suitable densities existing directly in the space of interest.

We now introduce the \emph{variational formulation} of Bayes' Rule, which expresses the posterior as the solution to an infinite-dimensional optimization problem.

\begin{proposition}[Bayes' Rule in variational form]
Assume TODO.
Then for every $\gamma\in Y$, the posterior distribution satisfies 
\[
\pi_{\theta\given y}(\.\given \gamma) = \argmin_{\bb{q}_\theta \in \c{M}_1(\Theta)} D_{\f{KL}}(\bb{q}_\theta \from \pi_\theta) - \operatorname*{\E}_{\vartheta\~\bb{q}_\theta} \ln f_{y\given\theta}(\gamma\given\vartheta)
\]
where the minima does not depend on the choice of reference measure used in defining the likelihood density.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
We prove the result twice, using two different techniques---by computations that involve Kullback--Leibler divergences, and by employing ideas from the calculus of variations.
We start with the former. 
Since the topology generated by the Kullback--Leibler divergence on the space of probability measures is Hausdorff, we have
\[
\pi_{\theta\given y}(\.\given \gamma) &= \argmin_{\bb{q}_\theta \in \c{M}_1(\Theta)} D_{\f{KL}}(\bb{q}_\theta \from \pi_{\theta\given y}(\.\given \gamma))
\]
TODO
\end{proof}

For any given dataset, this result shows that  Bayes' Rule can be viewed in \emph{information-theoretic} manner: among all probability measures, the posterior maximizes predictive power, while retaining as many bits as possible from the prior, in the sense given by the Kullback--Leibler divergence.

The result also suggests a way to approximately compute posterior distributions: solve the optimization problem on a suitably chosen subspace of the space of all probability measures $\c{M}_1(\Theta)$.
This strategy will be particularly fruitful in the later-described setting of Gaussian processes, where techniques for constructing such approximations with well-understood and favorable accuracy will be considered.

We will \emph{always} view variational approximations as minimization of Kullback--Leibler divergences, as this is mathematically sound.
We will eschew standard presentations involving \emph{evidence lower bounds}: the only mathematical explanations for why maximizing these bounds should improve model performance, that I am aware of, appeal to Kullback--Leibler divergences---so, then, why talk about evidence lower bounds in the first place?

Once a posterior is calculated, the next step is to extract the relevant quantities from it.
Traditionally, this is often done by displaying summary statistics to be evaluated and interpreted by a person with statistical training, often with a focus on assessing uncertainty.
We will instead focus on settings where the posterior is given as input to an upstream decision-making algorithm: we explore these next.

\subsection{Technical lemmas}

We now prove a number of technical lemmas used in the preceding text, which for completeness are presented here in order to avoid disrupting the reader's flow.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:rcrv-rvm-equiv}
Let $b:\Omega\x A\->B$ be a jointly measurable stochastic process.
Then the map $b_*\P : \c{B} \x A \-> [0,1]$, where the pushforward is taken in the first argument, is a probability kernel.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
It is clear that $b_* \P$ is a probability measure for all $a'\in A$, so we only need to prove that the map $a \|> (b(\.,a)_*\P)(A_b)$ is measurable for all $A_b\in\c{B}$.
First, write
\[
(b_*\P)(A_b) = \P(b(\.,a)^{-1}(A_b)) = \int_\Omega \1_{b(\omega,a)\in A_b} \d\bb{P}(\omega)
.
\]
Now, note that the map $\Omega\x A\->\R$ given by $(\omega,a) \|> \1_{b(\omega,a)\in A_b}$ is bounded measurable, since $b$ is measurable in both arguments, and indicators of measurable functions on measurable sets are bounded measurable.
Finally, since for any bounded measurable $f : \Omega \x A \-> \R$, the map $a \|> \int_\Omega f(\omega,a) \d\bb{P}(\omega)$ is measurable by Fubini's Theorem, the claim follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:cyl-prod}
Let $\pi : \c{A} \x \c{B} \-> [0,1]$ be a function satisfying the measure axioms.
Then $\pi$ extends uniquely to a measure on the product sigma-algebra.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Apply a $\pi$-$\lambda$ argument.
TODO.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:non-dupl-dep}
Let $a : \Omega \-> A$ be a random variable and $b : \Omega \x A \-> B$ be a jointly measurable stochastic process.
Suppose that for almost all $a'\in A$, the random variable $b(\.,a') : \Omega \-> B$ is independent of $a$.
Then for all bounded measurable functions $f$ we have
\[
\int_\Omega f(a(\omega),b(\omega,a(\omega))) \d\bb{P}(\omega) = \int_{\Omega\x\Omega}f(a(\omega),b(\omega',a(\omega))) \d\bb{P}^2(\omega,\omega')
.
\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
TODO.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:prod-density}
Let $\pi_{a,b}$ be a measure which admits a density with respect to $\lambda$.
Then $\pi_{a,b}(\.\x B)$ admits a density with respect to $\lambda(\.\x B)$, and similarly in the other argument.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Apply a Fubini-type argument.
TODO.
\end{proof}

\section{Statistical decision-making}

We now use the Bayesian formalism to construct a probabilistic theory of decision-making.
To begin, we formalize the very general concept of an abstract agent making decisions in an environment in pursuit of some goal.

\begin{definition}[Discrete-time Markov decision process]
A \emph{discrete-time Markov decision process} is a $4$-tuple consisting of the following.
\1 State space: a measurable space $S$.
\2 Action space: a measurable space $A$.
\3 Reward: a probability kernel $r : \c{B}(\R) \x X \x A \-> \R$. 
\4 Transition kernel: a probability kernel $p : \c{S} \x S \x A \-> \R$.
\0 
\end{definition}

This is a very broad notion---however, a number of variations are also possible.
For instance, one can consider continuous-time, purely deterministic, and partially observed analogs---each of these involve their own subtleties and deserve study in their own right, but we do not pursue them here.

The idea behind this definition is that, at every point in time, the agent observes the current state, chooses an action $a \in A$, and obtains another state $s' \~ p(s,a)$.
Note that \emph{time} can, and often will, be part of the state $s$.
The agent's goal is to choose each action so as to control the entire trajectory of states in order to obtain maximum rewards.
The choice of actions in every state is called a \emph{policy}, and is formalized as follows.

\begin{definition}[Policy]
Define the following.
\1 A measurable function $\pi : S \-> A$ is called a \emph{deterministic policy}.
\2 A probability kernel $\pi : \c{A} \x S \-> \R$ is called a \emph{Markov policy}.
\0 
\end{definition}

Markov policies include deterministic policies as a special case, by taking the conditional distributions to be Dirac and re-interpreting the given expressions appropriately.
As with Markov decision processes, here one can also consider even more general policies, but we do not do so here.

Different policies yield different state trajectories, and therefore different rewards.
Of these, some obtain more rewards than others: 

\begin{definition}[Optimal policy]
Let $T \in \N$ be the \emph{time horizon}.
A policy is called \emph{optimal} if it maximizes the \emph{value function} 
\[
V^{(\pi)}(x_0) = \E \sum_{t=0}^T r_t
\]
where $r_t \given s_t,a_t \~ r(s_t,a_t)$, $a_t \given s_t \~ \pi(s_t)$, and $s_{t+1} \given s_t,a_t \~ p(s_t, a_t)$.
\end{definition}

Finding an optimal policy therefore amounts to selecting the best possible actions to maximize total rewards.
It is therefore of key interest to find an optimal policy, if one exists.
Note that closely-related alternative notions of optimality, such as minimizing infinite discounted sums, or limits of averages, are also possible.
The most important distinction between different problems for finding optimal policies is given by what is assumed known.

\1 If $p$ and $r$ are known, we say we have an \emph{optimal control} problem.
\2 Otherwise, we say we have an \emph{decision} problem.
\0 

These classes differ fundamentally from one another. 
Optimal control problems can be viewed as a class of structured optimization problems, where the goal is to compute $\pi$ by evaluating $r$ and $p$ as necessary.
Here, one generally proceeds by proving that $V^{(\pi)}$ and $\pi$ satisfy certain recursive equations, and developing schemes for solving them.

Decision problems do not behave in this manner.
Due to the rewards or dynamics being \emph{unknown}, they cannot simply be maximized and their expectation must be \emph{learned}.
This forces one to consider whether to take advantage of actions known to be good, or to try others in case they might be better---this is known as the \emph{explore-exploit tradeoff}.
For such settings, we need an appropriate solution concept---to obtain one, define the following.

\begin{definition}[Regret]
The \emph{regret} of a policy $\pi$ is defined as 
\[
R^{(\pi)}(x_0) = V^*(x_0) - V^{(\pi)}(x_0)
\]
where $V^*$ is the optimal value function, which is assumed to exist.
\end{definition}

Minimizing regret is equivalent to maximizing value, but when $p$ and $r$ are unknown doing so directly is impossible.
Instead, the goal is to find an \emph{algorithm}---that is, a way of updating the policy based on observed data---so as to limit growth of regret.

In most settings, one can prove that every algorithm which does not know $p$ and $r$ necessarily incurs some level of regret.
This is done by exhibiting a randomized set of problems and rewards over which regret is lower-bounded in expectation for any algorithm.
In such a class, actions that perform well on one problem will necessarily perform badly on another problem.
Such arguments show that some degree of regret is inevitable.

On the other hand, some algorithms incur more regret than others.
The obviously-bad algorithm which learns nothing and chooses the exact same action over and over again incurs at most linear regret.
An algorithm is said to \emph{solve} a decision problem if its asymptotic regret rate with respect to $T$ matches the respective regret lower bound in the given problem class.
Finding such algorithms is of key interest.

One way to construct algorithms for solving decision problems is to employ a \emph{model-based} approach, which loosely speaking works as follows.

\1 Learn the unknown transitions and/or rewards from observed data using a supervised learning approach.
\2 Use the learned model(s) to find policy satisfying some criteria.
\0 

The details of such approaches depends on the setting.
We distinguish between two key kinds of decision problems.

\1 If $|S| = 1$, it is known as a \emph{multi-armed bandit} problem.
\2 Otherwise, it is known as a \emph{reinforcement learning} problem.
\0 

Multi-armed bandits possess no variable state, and thus only require one to learn the rewards and determine which actions are optimal.
Reinforcement learning allows actions to influence transitions between states, and requires long-term planning, making it much more general, difficult, and important.
I believe that as a mathematical theory, reinforcement learning is powerful enough to describe many aspects of human and animal intelligence, making it a fundamentally interesting theory to study and develop.

We now restrict ourselves to the bandit setting, which is substantially easier to study and so can be understood much more deeply.
Here, even when $A$ is a finite set and the rewards are Gaussian, the model-based approach consisting of (i) estimating rewards using empirical risk minimization and (ii) choosing the policy which maximizes rewards is known to be non-optimal.
This approach fails to explore, and can get stuck chasing sub-optimal rewards.

One way to fix this problem is to replace empirical risk minimization with Bayesian learning, and adopt an appropriate decision rule for selecting actions.
Doing this yields approaches which can be shown optimal in many settings.
We therefore proceed to study multi-armed bandits in more detail.

\subsection{Multi-armed bandits}

The multi-armed bandit problem takes its name from a casino analogy.
In the 1950s, slot machines often had levers one could pull instead of buttons one could press, and were called \emph{one-armed bandits} for their ability to empty gamblers' wallets.
A \emph{multi-armed bandit} is a slot machine which for a fixed cost, allows one to pull an arm $x \in X$, and receive a random reward whose distribution depends on $x$.
The goal is to minimize  expected loss, or, equivalently, maximize total expected rewards.

Multi-armed bandits can be viewed as discrete-time Markov decision processes with a one-element state space, but this is not necessarily the most fruitful way to think about them.
We thus begin by introducing formalism and notation better suited to the given setting, which can be viewed as special cases of the notions considered previously.

\begin{definition}[Multi-armed bandit]
Let $f : X \-> \R$ be bounded above function, let $\eps : \Omega \x X \-> \R$ be a stochastic process such that $\E(\eps(x)) = 0$, and let $y(\omega,x) = f(x) + \eps(\omega,x)$.
Define the following.
\1 We say that the Markov decision process $(\{1\},X,y_*\P,\delta_{1})$, with $\delta_1$ defined below, is a \emph{multi-armed bandit}.
\2 We say that a probability kernel  $\pi : \c{X} \x \bigoplus_{n=1}^\infty (X \x [0,1])^n \-> \R$ is a \emph{multi-armed bandit algorithm}.
\0
Here, $\delta_1$ is the Dirac measure centered at $1$ for all actions $x\in X$, which is the only possible conditional probability distribution over a one-element set, and $\bigoplus$ denotes the disjoint union of measurable spaces.
\end{definition}

An algorithm, then, assigns every dataset of arbitrary size to a probability measure describing what arms should be picked with what probability.
Each dataset consists of $(x, y)$ pairs where $x$ are the locations chosen by the algorithm, and $y$ are the noisy observed values---recall $\omega$ is the randomness used by the noise.
Some algorithms maximize $f$ faster than others---we consider this next.

\begin{definition}[Regret]
For a given multi-armed bandit, let $f(x^*)$ be the global maxima of $f$. 
Define the \emph{regret} of an algorithm $\pi$ at time $T$ to be
\[
R(T) = \sum_{t=1}^T f(x^*) - f(x_t)
\]
where $x_t \~ \pi(y_0,..,y_{t-1})$, $y_t = f(x_t) + \eps_t$, and $\eps_t \~ \eps(x)$.
\end{definition}

Regret behavior in multi-armed bandit problems is strongly dependent on properties of the underlying function $f$, and in particular its domain $X$.
It is clear by considering for instance $X = \R$ that if $X$ is too large or too unstructured, no algorithm achieves better than linear regret.
We therefore begin studying the simplest non-trivial domain class.

\begin{definition}[$K$-armed bandit]
We say that a multi-armed bandit defined over a finite set with cardinality $K=|X|$ is a \emph{$K$-armed bandit}.
Moreover, if $y(\.,x)$ is a Bernoulli random variable for all $x$, we say it is a \emph{Bernoulli bandit}.
\end{definition}

What kind of performance is possible on such a problem?
One can ask and answer this question as follows.

\begin{theorem}
For any algorithm defined over a class of $K$-armed bandits there is an $f$ such that
\[
\E(R(T)) \geq \Omega(\sqrt{KT})
.
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We prove there is a class of random functions $f$ over which every algorithm achieves high regret in expectation, and hence a high-regret $f$ must exist.
TODO.
\end{proof}

This tells us that regret is necessarily incurred as consequence of not knowing the expected rewards of each arm given by $f$.
The next step, then, is to ask: is there an algorithm which achieves this rate?
We first consider simply evaluating each arm once, and then making choices according to the empirical averages.

\begin{proposition}
For a Bernoulli bandit, the algorithm which chooses actions by first trying each arm out once, and then selecting arms according to the maximum empirical average
\[
x_{t+1} &= \argmax_{x\in X} \mu_t(x)
&
\mu_t(x) &= \frac{\sum_{t=1}^T \1_{y_t = 1} \1_{x_t = x}}{\sum_{t=1}^T \1_{x_t = x}}
\]
does not achieve optimal regret.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
TODO.
\end{proof}

This algorithm therefore fails to resolve the explore-exploit tradeoff, and gets stuck with suboptimal choices.
As an alternative, consider a conjugate model with a simple uncertainty-based decision rule for selecting arms.

\begin{definition}[Beta--Bernoulli--UCB algorithm]
Define a Bayesian model via the likelihood $\gamma(x) \~[Ber](\mu(x))$ and prior $\mu(x) \~[Beta](a,b)$.
Define the \emph{beta--Bernoulli upper confidence bound} algorithm which selects actions by maximizing the function
\[
x_{t+1} &= \argmax_{x\in X} f^+_t(x) 
&
f^+_t(x) &= \mu_t(x) + \sigma_t(x)
\]
where $(\mu_t, \sigma_t)$ are the mean and standard deviation of the posterior distribution $\mu\given\gamma(x_1) = y_1, .., \gamma(x_t) = y_t$.
\end{definition}

We now consider this algorithm's regret.
It turns out this simple modification is enough to result in different regret behavior.

\begin{theorem}
Beta--Bernoulli--UCB achieves an expected regret of
\[
\E(R(T)) \leq \tl{\c{O}}(\sqrt{KT})
\]
uniformly for all $f$ where $\tl{\c{O}}$ denotes asymptotics up to logarithmic factors.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
TODO.
\end{proof}

This means that our proposed algorithm, which uncertainty built via the posterior distribution, suffices to balance exploration and exploitation in this setting.
This behavior is not unique to the given model, nor to the upper confidence bound rule.
More generally, a function $\alpha : X \-> \R$ constructed using a posterior distribution is called an \emph{acquition function}.
Many different acquisition functions for the given setting have been proposed.

We now proceed to explore a more general setting which will enable us to employ the ideas developed so far to develop efficient black-box optimization algorithms.
This will enable us to use Bayesian methods to solve a broad class of decision problems of practical interest.

\subsection{Bayesian optimization}

We now describe a formalism for using ideas built on Bayesian learning and multi-armed bandits for designing global optimization algorithms.
Our goal now is to minimize a black-box function
\[
f : X \-> \R    
\]
which is assumed continuous, and defined on a closed compact set $X \subseteq \R^d$.
Such a function is automatically bounded.
Our goal is to minimize $f$ with as few evaluations as possible.

To measure performance, we will again introduce a notion of regret.
Define
\[
R(T) = \sum_{t=1}^T f(x_t) - f(x^*)    
\]
where we have used the opposite sign convention compared to bandits and reinforcement learning, because our goal is to minimize $f$ rather than maximizing rewards.
Note that unlike before, for a deterministic algorithm this is now a purely deterministic quantity, and not a random variable.

As before, we can approach this problem by building a Bayesian model.
For an arbitrary sequence of points $x_1,..,x_t$, define the likelihood
\[
y_t(\omega) &= f(x_t) + \eps_t(\omega)
&
\eps_t &\~[N](0,\sigma^2)
.
\]
Here, the data is $Y = \R^n$, and our quantity of interest is the actual \emph{function} $f$, which we view as an element of an infinite-dimensional vector space, say, for instance, the space of continuous functions $C^0(X;\R)$.

It is now clear why we bothered with setting up a dense, abstract formalism for Bayesian learning in general measure spaces: this formalism is rich and powerful enough to enable us to properly define priors on spaces like this---we explore these in the sequel.
Suppose for the moment that this is possible.
Then, we can calculate the posterior distribution
\[
f \given y_1,..,y_t
\]
which is now a probability measure supported on $C^0(X;\R)$.
To determine the next point to query, we introduce and maximize an acquisition function.
Typical acquisition functions include the \emph{upper confidence bound} acquisition function considered previously, as well as \emph{Thompson sampling}
\[
x_{t+1}(\omega) &= \argmax_{x\in X} \phi_t(\omega,x)
&
\phi_t&\~ f \given y_1,..,y_t
\]
which is a \emph{random} acquisition function, and \emph{expected improvement}
\[
x_{t+1} = \argmax_{x\in X} \E \max(0,f_t(\omega,x) - f(x^*_t))
\]
where $f_t = f \given y_1,..,y_t$ is the posterior, and $x^*_t = \argmin_{t \in \{1,..,t\}} f(x_t)$ is the smallest value observed so far.
A more recent and particularly promising approach is \emph{information-directed sampling}, which is given by
\[
x_{t+1}(\omega) &= \argmax_{x\in X} \psi_t(\omega,x)
&
\psi_t &\~ \frac{\Delta^2_t}{I_t}
\]
where, again letting $f_t = f \given y_1,..,y_t$, we have $\Delta_t(\omega,x) = f_t(\omega,x) - f^*_t(\omega)$ is the a posteriori regret, $f^*_t(\omega) = \min_{x\in X} f_t(\omega,x)$ is the random minima under the current posterior, and $I_t(x) = I(f^*_t; f_t(\.,x))$ is the mutual information between a given value, and the a posteriori optimal value.\footnote{TODO: check me.}
Variations of this algorithm have been shown optimal in a number of settings.

Regret analysis for all of these choices is possible, and will in general depend on the detailed properties on the model, acquisition function, and the unknown function $f$.
In particular, regularity and smoothness properties may play a role, as well as structure present in the domain $X$.
In settings where the function $f$ is unknown, it's also possible to analyze the expression 
\[
BR(T) = \E \sum_{t=1}^T f(\omega,x_t) - f(\omega,x^*(\omega))    
\]
where minima and regret are now considered in expectation with respect to the prior---this is called the \emph{Bayesian regret}.
Some acquisition functions, such as Thompson sampling, admit particularly simple analyses in this setting.

This concludes our development and showcasing of decision-making algorithms.
We now proceed to develop the final piece of the puzzle not yet studied in detail: how to place priors on function spaces, in order to build Bayesian models for settings such as Bayesian optimization.

\section{Gaussian processes}

A Gaussian process can be thought of as a collection of random variables which, no matter what angle one views them from, yield Gaussian marginal distributions.
In the following, I will describe a formalism for making this description precise, starting from the simplest setting possible before moving to increasing levels of abstraction and generality.
Our goal will be to develop the notion of a Gaussian process $f : \Omega \-> V$ where $(\Omega,\c{F},\P)$ is a probability space and $V$ is a real topological vector space, almost always equipped with additional structure.
Gaussian process are fundamentally \emph{linear} objects which reflect the structure of the topological vector spaces over which they are defined.
The simplest settings arise when $V$ is smallest.

\1  Choosing $V = \{0\}$ to be the trivial vector space, there is exactly one $V$-valued random variable, whose distribution is the Dirac measure centered at $0$, which can trivially be called Gaussian.
This random variable is not very interesting, so we do not consider it further.
\2 Choosing $V = \R$ to coincide with the underlying scalar field yields the setting of \emph{Gaussian random variables}.
This is the next-simplest setting and the first one we explore in detail.
\3 Choosing $V = \R^d$ yields the setting of \emph{Gaussian random vectors}, whose components are multivariate Gaussian---or, equivalently, whose \emph{dot products} are scalar-valued Gaussian---an alternative view which will become important later.
\4 Choosing $V$ to be a suitable vector space of functions $f : X \-> \R$ yields the setting of Gaussian processes, whose finite-dimensional marginals are multivariate Gaussian.
This setting is well-studied when $X$ is itself a Euclidean space: in Chapter \ref{ch:noneuclidean}, we will examine cases where $X$ instead possesses geometric structure inherited by the Gaussian process.
\5 Finally, choosing $V$ to be a possibly infinite-dimensional vector space, such as a Banach of Hilbert space---this yields the most general setting we examine.
This level of generality will be important for two reasons: (i) to develop a coordinate-free notion of Gaussian random vectors that will be useful in the differential-geometric setting, and (ii) to develop a formalism rich enough to define white noise processes, which will be needed in Chapter \ref{ch:noneuclidean}.
\0 

We proceed to examine the scalar case.

\subsection{Gaussian random variables}

A Gaussian random variable is a map which takes in an abstract random number, and returns a real scalar.
To begin formalizing this notion, let $(\Omega,\c{F},\P)$ be a probability space, and here and henceforth, equip all topological vector spaces with their respective Borel $\sigma$-algebras. 
The basic object from which other Gaussians will be constructed is the standard scalar Gaussian, defined as follows.

\begin{definition}[Standard Gaussian random variable]
A random variable $z : \Omega\->\R$ is called \emph{standard Gaussian} if it admits the Lebesgue density
\[
f(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\del{-\frac{z^2}{2}}
.
\]
\end{definition}

From this, we define general scalar Gaussians.

\begin{definition}[Gaussian random variable]
A random variable $y : \Omega\->\R$ is called \emph{Gaussian} if there are scalars $\mu, \sigma\in\R$, and a standard Gaussian $z$, such that
\[
y = \sigma z + \mu
.
\]
\end{definition}

Note that we do \emph{not} require $\sigma \geq 0$: hence, every Gaussian random variable is determined uniquely in 
distribution by the pair $(\mu,\sigma^2)$, which we call its \emph{mean} and \emph{variance}, respectively. 
We write $y \~[N](\mu,\sigma^2)$.
True to these parameter names, we have
\[
\E(y) &= \mu
&
\E\del{(y - \mu)^2} &= \sigma^2
.
\]
A Gaussian random variable is called \emph{centered} if $\mu = 0$.
For a given variance $\sigma^2$ and standard Gaussian $z$, the expressions $\sigma z$ and $-\sigma z$ define two \emph{different} centered Gaussians with the same distribution.
At this stage, pointing these distinctions may appear needlessly pedantic: they will become more pronounced and important once we consider more general objects.
The density of a Gaussian random variable, if it exists, takes on a form analogous to that of a standard Gaussian, namely
\[
f(y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} \exp\del{-\frac{(y-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
.
\]
which shows that the densities of Gaussian random variables respect the additive and multiplicative structures of the reals---this compatibility with linear structure will be true at all levels of generality we consider.
Note that the density will not exist if $\sigma^2 = 0$: the distributions of such Gaussians are Dirac measures centered at $\mu$.
We are now ready to lift this definition to construct multivariate analogs.

\subsection{Gaussian random vectors}

A multivariate Gaussian random vector is a random variable taking values in $\R^d$.
We will distinguish $\R^d$ from a generic $d$-dimensional vector space: the former comes with a product structure $\R^d = \R \x .. \x \R$ which includes projection maps onto each coordinate, which in turn induce a \emph{canonical} choice of inner product given by the Euclidean dot product.
A generic finite-dimensional vector space lacks this structure: it admits many different inner products, and provides for no canonical choice---this difference will become important in the sequel.
We write vectors defined in $\R^d$ in bold italics to emphasize this distinction, and similarly distinguish matrices from linear maps by writing the former in bold upface letters.
As before, we begin by defining a standard Gaussian, which we note is an inner-product-dependent notion.

\begin{definition}[Standard multivariate Gaussian random variable]
A random variable $\v{z} : \Omega\->\R^d$ is called \emph{standard multivariate Gaussian} if if its distribution is the product measure of the distributions of $d$ standard Gaussians.
\end{definition}

One can easily see that this definition works in $\R^d$, but fails in a generic finite-dimensional vector space $V$ unless it is equipped with an inner product.
If $V$ does admit an inner product, a standard Gaussian can be defined by choosing an orthonormal basis with respect to the given inner product, adapting the above definition, and showing that it is well-defined by virtue of not depending on the choice of basis.
This is easy to see, since linear maps associated with changes of orthonormal bases are represented by orthogonal matrices.
As before, we will again define multivariate Gaussians as transformations of standard Gaussians.

\begin{definition}[Multivariate Gaussian random variable]
A random variable $\v{y} : \Omega\->\R^d$ is called \emph{multivariate Gaussian} if there is a vector $\v\mu\in\R^d$, matrix $\m{L}\in\R^{d\x d}$, and standard multivariate Gaussian $\v{z}$, such that
\[
\v{y} = \m{L}\v{z} + \v\mu
.
\]
\end{definition}

Every multivariate Gaussian is determined by its \emph{mean vector} $\v\mu$ and positive semi-definite \emph{covariance matrix} $\m\Sigma = \m{L}\m{L}^T$, and, as before, is called \emph{centered} if $\v\mu = \v{0}$.
We write $\v{y}\~[N](\v\mu,\m\Sigma)$ can obtain a centered multivariate Gaussian with a given distribution by calculating a \emph{matrix square root} of $\m\Sigma$, multiplying it with a standard Gaussian.
Just as before, we have
\[
\E(\v{y}) &= \v\mu    
&
\Cov(\v{y}) &= \E\del{(\v{y}-\v\mu)(\v{y}-\v\mu)^T} = \m\Sigma
\]
and, if the determinant $|\m\Sigma|$ is non-zero,
\[
f(\v{y}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^d|\m\Sigma|}} \exp\del{-\frac{1}{2}(\v{y}-\v\mu)^T\m\Sigma^{-1}(\v{y}-\v\mu)}
\]
which now might not exist even if the distribution of $\v{y}$ is not Dirac.
In such cases, one can see that at least some of the eigenvalues of $\m\Sigma$ must be zero, and so Gaussians which do not admit densities must, when viewed in an appropriate basis, be products of Dirac measures with Gaussians which do admit densities.
Already in the multivariate case, then, we see the technical power of densities weakening: this behavior will become even more pronounced as we consider more general settings, which we now proceed to study.


\subsection{Gaussian random functions}

We now consider Gaussian random functions, which are the first notion of a Gaussian random variable that is generally called a \emph{Gaussian process}.
Initially, we will adopt a \emph{bottom-up} view which, from a technical perspecrtive, departs considerably from the notions introduced so far.
A more general and much more natural function-analytic view will be introduced in the sequel.
For now, recall that for a set $X$, an $\R$-valued \emph{random process} is defined as a map $f : \Omega \x X \-> \R$ such that, for every $x$, the map $f(\.,x) : \Omega \-> \R$ is a random variable.
If we have a set of points $x_1,..,x_n \in X$, we can plug them into $f$ to obtain a map $(f(x_1),..,f(x_n)) : \Omega \-> \R^n$, which, by virtue of being a product of measurable maps, is a random variable---we call it a \emph{finite-dimensional marginal random variable}.
A Gaussian process, then, is simply a random process whose finite-dimensional marginals are multivariate Gaussian.

\begin{definition}[Gaussian process in the random process sense]
Let $X$ be a set. 
A random process $f: \Omega \x X \-> \R$ is called a \emph{Gaussian process} if, for any finite set of points $x_1,..,x_n \in X$, the random variable $(f(\.,x_1),..,f(\.,x_n)) : \Omega \-> \R^n$ is multivariate Gaussian.
\end{definition}

Immediately upon writing this definition, one is left to wonder: does it actually make sense?
In particular, do Gaussian processes in the sense given here exist?
Under general conditions on the finite-dimensional marginals, Kolmogorov's Consistency Theorem states that there exists a unique probability measure on the cylindrical $\sigma$-algebra whose finite-dimensional projections coincide with the distributions of the random variables written above.
Since \emph{every} probability measure trivially admits random variables whose distribution is said measure, Gaussian processes in the sense given here exist so long as a family of multivariate Gaussians satisfying the conditions of Kolmogorov's Consistency Theorem can be found.

The same results also allow us to reinterpret Gaussian processes as \emph{function-valued random variables}, which, in many ways, are a much more natural point of view to take.
Define $\R^X = \{f : X \-> \R\}$ equip it with the cylindrical $\sigma$-algebra to make it into a measurable space.

\begin{definition}[Gaussian process in the random variable sense]
Let $X$ be a set. 
A random variable $f: \Omega \-> \R^X$ is called a \emph{Gaussian process} if, for any finite set of points $x_1,..,x_n \in X$, the random variable $(f(\.)(x_1),..,f(\.)(x_n)) : \Omega \-> \R^n$ is multivariate Gaussian.
\end{definition}

It is clear that every Gaussian process in the random process sense induces a Gaussian process in the random variable sense, and vice versa.
Thus, these two notions are simply two different ways of viewing the same object.

We can then ask, what properties of multivariate Gaussians are still true in this setting?
Since a Gaussian process is uniquely determined by its finite-dimensional marginals, we need to find functions that generate a family of mean vectors and covariance matrices which are positive semi-definite.
The former is straightforward: every function $\mu : X \-> \R$ can be evaluated at a finite set of points $x_1,..,x_n$ to obtain a mean vector $\v\mu = \mu(x_1,..,x_n)$.
The latter requires only slightly more thinking.

\begin{definition}[Positive semi-definite kernel]
A symmetric function $k : X \x X \-> \R$ is called a \emph{positive semi-definite kernel} if, for any finite set of points $x_1,..,x_n\in X$, the kernel matrix
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
k(x_1,x_1) & \dots &k(x_1,x_n)
\\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots 
\\
k(x_n,x_1) & \dots & k(x_n,x_n)
\end{bmatrix}
\]
is positive semi-definite.
\end{definition}

The \emph{covariance kernel} of a Gaussian process then is defined by
\[
k(x,x') = \Cov(f(x),f(x'))    
.
\]
It is then clear that the pair $(\mu,k)$ uniquely define a Gaussian process, and so we write $f\~[GP](\mu,k)$.
Defining a Gaussian process then amounts to defining a positive semi-definite kernel. 
In the Euclidean case, this can be done straightforwardly by noting that (i) the linear kernel $k(x,x') = \innerprod{x}{x'}$ is positive semi-definite by non-degeneracy of the inner product, (ii) that sums, powers, and limits of positive semi-definite kernels as positive semi-definite.
By this technique, we see that the widely-used exponential and squared exponential kernels are positive semi-definite.
It is also clear that, as before, affine maps preserve Gaussianity.

The other properties previously considered, however, do not survive into this setting.
In particular, it is clear that, as an infinite-dimensional object, $f$ does not admit a probability density analogous to the ones considered previously, because an infinite-dimensional Lebesgue measure, in the sense of a locally finite translation invariant measure, does not exist.
We will therefore give up on and completely abandon this point of view, except where its finite-dimensional version suffices.
It is also not clear what a \emph{standard} Gaussian process might be, nor how to view general Gaussian processes as transformations of standard Gaussian processes, nor what the analog of a matrix square root of a positive semi-definite kernel might be.

The loss of these technical tools has consequences on what can be said about Gaussian processes.
In Chapter \ref{ch:noneuclidean}, we will study Gaussian processes whose set $X$ is a Riemannian manifold, or a weighted directed graph.
In those settings, one cannot begin by proving positive semi-definiteness of linear kernels, because there is simply no useful analog of this concept.
Indeed, proving proving positive semi-definiteness can end up highly non-trivial, and most positive semi-definite functions will not admit simple expressions, like they do in the Euclidean case.
We therefore proceed to adopt a function-analytic perspective which is more technical, but significantly powerful, and will allow us to recover the previous set of tools in a much more pure and abstract form.
