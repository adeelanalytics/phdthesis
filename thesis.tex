\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}

\lettrine{L}{earning} from experience in order to change behavior is one of the defining abilities of biological systems, which differentiates them from other kinds of systems found in the world.
Replicating the processes biological systems use to learn and adapt is a fundamental goal of science and technology.
To this end, the development of mathematical formalisms rich enough to capture the notion of learning is one of the crowning achievements of statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

One such formalism is the \emph{Bayesian} view of learning.
The idea behind Bayesian learning is to represent the information known about the quantity of interest using probability.
The relationship between the quantity of interest and the data is formalized as a joint probability distribution.
This gives rise to a conditional probability distribution describing what was learned about the quantity of interest by observing the data.


Bayesian learning fits naturally within a theory of \emph{decision}, which describes how an abstract decision system should select actions in pursuit of a goal.
This is done by learning how different actions affect pursuit of the goal, and selecting optimal actions consistent with what was learned.
By virtue of being probabilistic, such decisions systems assess and propagate uncertainty, enabling them to balance what is already known with what could be learned by taking actions---a concept known as the \emph{explore-exploit~tradeoff}.

The performance of a decision system can be evaluated by examining how quickly its decisions improve and become optimal.
A decision system's \emph{regret} is the reduction in its quality of decisions by virtue of not knowing the quantity of interest in advance.
In most non-trivial settings, one can show that some regret is inevitable: a decision-making system must make some mistakes in order to learn.
A decision system is considered \emph{optimal} if its regret is within a constant factor of the best possible regret.

Decisions systems with optimal or close-to-optimal regret require less data in order to solve their respective tasks, and are called \emph{data-efficient}.
Data-efficiency is a key concern in practical settings, where data-collection takes time and can be expensive.
By virtue of resolving explore-exploit tradeoffs in a manner amenable to regret analysis, the Bayesian formalism gives broad tools for constructing data-efficient decision systems.

The key limitation of the Bayesian approach is that it often leads to computational problems which are intractable.
Conditional distributions generally contain more information than actually needed to make optimal decisions, yet calculating them is largely unavoidable.
Probabilistic decision systems are thus most attractive in settings where their strengths---including data-efficiency, solid technical foundations, and amenability to analysis---can shine, while computational costs are kept under control.

In my view, \emph{Gaussian processes} are one such setting: they are powerful enough to model wide classes of unknown quantities of interest, yet their computational costs are generally polynomial.
Better yet, Gaussian-process-based decision systems have demonstrated excellent performance in real-world scientific applications.
Studying Gaussian processes is therefore a promising avenue towards improved understanding of Bayesian learning and Bayesian decision-making in pursuit of artificial intelligence.

The goals of this dissertation are twofold: (i) to make Gaussian processes easier to work with when used within larger decision systems, and (ii) to expand the set of settings where Gaussian processes can used, enabling construction of decision systems for applications not previously considered.
Contributions toward (i) include path-wise conditioning techniques studied in \Cref{ch:pathwise}, and contributions toward (ii) include non-Euclidean Gaussian processes studied in \Cref{ch:noneuclidean}.
Following these, \Cref{ch:conclusion} concludes.

To pursue these goals, it is critically important that all of the concepts described in the preceding paragraphs be made into rigorous mathematics, so that the ideas described in the sequel ultimately reduce to definitions and implications, and not metaphor or opinion.
Together, we therefore begin by defining the key mathematical notions needed.

\section{Bayesian learning}

The first concept we develop in depth along our path towards a mathematically precise understanding of statistical decision-making is \emph{Bayesian learning}---a mathematical formalism for reasoning about unknown quantities of interest on the basis of data.
Bayesian learning is a \emph{probabilistic} theory: a model specifies how the quantity of interest and the data depend on one another within a probability distribution.
Learning entails calculating how the distribution of the quantity of interest changes upon observing the data.

One of the key strengths of Bayesian theory is that it applies in wide generality, owing to the substantial scope of probability theory. 
In particular, one can study learning of quantities of interest that are function-valued using observed data consisting of pointwise function evaluations.
This, however, requires a non-elementary treatment, as one cannot rely on probability densities to define what conditional distributions are.
We therefore begin by recalling the necessary mathematical formalism.

\subsection{Review of probability theory}
We adopt the language of measure-theoretic probability, which we now describe.
To ease presentation, we state the definitions together with useful ways of thinking about them.


We say that \emphmarginnote{measurable space} is a pair $(Y,\c{Y})$ consisting of a set $Y$ and a $\sigma$-algebra $\c{Y}$ over $Y$.
A \emph{$\sigma$-algebra} is a set of subsets of $Y$ containing the space itself which is closed under countable unions, intersections, complements, and therefore set-theoretic monotone limits.
These can be reinterpreted as Boolean logical operations, so $\c{Y}$ can be thought of as the set of all true-false questions one can ask about elements of the set $Y$. 
These questions, then, are closed under \emph{and/or/not} operations and monotone limits thereof.

\parmarginnote{Product of measurable spaces}
Given two measurable spaces $(Y,\c{Y})$ and $(\Theta,\mathit\Theta)$, if we form the Cartesian product $Y \x \Theta$, then we can define the \emph{product $\sigma$-algebra} $\c{Y}\ox\mathit\Theta$ as the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing all sets of the form $A_y \x A_\theta$ with $A_y \in\c{Y}$ and $A_\theta\in\mathit\Theta$.
\marginnote{Measurable subspace}
For a measurable subset $Y' \subseteq Y$, we can define $\c{Y}' = \{A_y \^ Y' : A_y \in\c{Y}\}$, which is also a $\sigma$-algebra, thereby making $(Y',\c{Y}')$ into a measurable space. 
We call $\c{Y}'$ the \emph{subset $\sigma$-algebra}.
If $Y$ is a topological space, the \emphmarginnote{Borel $\sigma$-algebra} $\c{B}(Y)$ is defined as the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing the open sets.

\parmarginnote{Measurable function}
A map $f : Y \-> Y'$ between measurable spaces $(Y,\c{Y})$ and $(Y',\c{Y}')$ is said to be \emph{measurable} if its preimage defines a map $f^{-1} : \c{Y}' \-> \c{Y}$ between the respective $\sigma$-algebras.
This intuitively means that true-false questions for the space $Y'$ can be asked and answered relative to those in $Y$.
On product spaces, a map $f : Y \-> \Theta \x \Theta'$ is measurable if its components are measurable, but a map $f : Y \x Y' \-> \Theta$ \emph{need not} automatically be measurable if $f(\.,y') : Y \-> \Theta$ and $f(y,\.) : Y' \-> \Theta$ are measurable for all $y$ and $y'$.

A \emphmarginnote{probability measure} is a non-negative countably additive map $\pi_y : \c{Y} \-> \R$ satisfying $\pi_Y(Y) = 1$. 
This can be thought of as a map that takes a true/false question, and assigns a number indicating how close to true or false its answer is according to the measure---in this view, probability measures describe uncertainty.
A \emphmarginnote{probability space} $(\Omega,\c{F},\P)$ consists of a measurable space and probability measure.
The set $\Omega$ can be viewed as a space of abstract random numbers, with a random number generator described by $\P$.

Given a probability space, we say that a \emphmarginnote{random variable} is a measurable map $y : \Omega \-> Y$.
A random variable, then, maps random numbers $\omega\in\Omega$ into the space $Y$.
The \emph{distribution}\marginnote{Distribution} of a random variable is defined as the \emph{pushforward measure} $\pi_y = y_* \P$ where $y_*$ is defined as $(y_* \P)(A_y) = \P(y^{-1}(A_y))$ for all $A_y\in\c{Y}$.
The probability of an event $A_y$, then, is determined by measuring the probability of random numbers under which $A_y$ occurs---measurability guarantees this is possible.

\parmarginnote{Notation for random variables}
In this work, we will generally \emph{not} adopt the standard convention of suppressing $\omega$-arguments of random variables from our notation, and will write such arguments explicitly in cases that other function arguments are also used.
Though this makes expressions slightly denser, it also avoids ambiguity and presents the mathematics more precisely.

\parmarginnote{Equality of random variables}
There are multiple senses in which we can say random variables are equal.
We say that $y = y'$ \emph{surely} if they are equal as mathematical functions.
This notion is essentially never used, because it is exceedingly strong.
We say that $y = y'$ \emph{almost surely} if $\P(y \neq y') = 0$, in which case $y$ and $y'$ are equal as functions, except possibly on a set of probability zero.
We say that $y = y'$ \emph{in distribution} if $y_* \P = y'_* \P$, meaning their distributions are equal.

\parmarginnote{Existence of a random variable with given distribution}
For a given probability space $(\Omega,\c{F},\P)$, a random variable $y : \Omega \-> Y$ with distribution $\pi_y$ need not exist.
However, if it does not, there always exists another probability space $(\Omega',\c{F}',\P')$ and a measurable map $i : \Omega' \-> \Omega$ such that $\P = i_* \P'$, and for which a $\pi_y$-distributed random variable $y : \Omega' \-> Y$ \emph{does} exist.
We will thus implicitly assume all probability spaces are large enough to ensure all random variables with prescribed distributions exist.

\parmarginnote{Probability kernel}
We will be interested in probability measures extended to allow them to be parameterized by other quantities.
A \emph{probability kernel} is defined to be a map $\pi_{y\given\theta} : \c{Y} \x \Theta \-> \R$ satisfying two conditions: (i) the map $\pi_{y\given\theta}(\.,\vartheta) : \c{Y} \-> \R$ is a probability measure for all $\vartheta\in\Theta$, and (ii) the map $\pi_{y\given\theta}(A_y,\.) : \Theta \-> \R$ is measurable for all $A_y\in\c{Y}$.

\parmarginnote{Conditional distribution}
Random variables can also be extended to parameterize them by other quantities.
A $\c{F}\ox \mathit\Theta$-measurable map $y\given\theta : \Omega \x \Theta \-> Y$ is called a \emph{jointly measurable stochastic process}---we largely eschew this terminology to emphasize the Bayesian formalism.
In particular, unlike most presentations of stochastic processes, we \emph{never} think of $\Theta$ as representing time.
Define the \emph{conditional distribution} of $y\given\theta$ to be $(y\given\theta)_*\P$, with the pushforward taken in the first argument---by \Cref{lem:rcrv-rvm-equiv}, this is a probability kernel.


\subsection{Bayes' Rule for probability measures}

The key idea behind Bayesian learning is to formalize \emph{learning} using the concept of \emph{conditional probability}.
This entails (i) building a model quantifying the relationship between the \emph{quantity of interest} $\theta$, and the \emph{data} $y$, and (ii) quantifying what is learned using Bayes' Rule.
We now begin to make these concepts precise in the language of measure-theoretic probability.

\begin{definition}[Bayesian model]
Let $Y$ and $\Theta$ be sets.
A \emph{Bayesian model} is a probability measure defined on $\Theta \x Y$.
\end{definition}

A model can be constructed in a number of different ways.
The most common technique is to specify two components: (i) a probability distribution describing what is known about the quantity of interest external to the data, and (ii) how the data relates to the quantity of interest.
These are called the \emph{prior distribution} and \emph{likelihood}, respectively.
For example, a simple Gaussian model is given by
\[
y_i \given &\theta \~[N](\theta, 1)
&
\theta &\~[N](0,1)
.
\]
In this model, $\theta$ is an unknown scalar assigned a standard normal prior, while $y_i\given\theta$ is assigned a Gaussian likelihood centered at $\theta$.
Our first goal is to make this notation into proper mathematics.

\begin{proposition}
A Bayesian model can be constructed in the following ways.
\1 Using measures: integrate the following two components.
\1 \emph{Prior}: a probability measure $\pi_\theta : \mathit\Theta \-> \R$.
\2 \emph{Likelihood}: a probability kernel $\pi_{y\given\theta} : \c{Y}\x\Theta \-> \R$.
\0 
\2 Using random variables: compose the following two components.
\1 \emph{Prior}: a random variable $\theta:\Omega\->\Theta$.
\2 \emph{Likelihood}: a jointly measurable stochastic process $y\given\theta: \Omega\x\Theta\->Y$.
\0 
\0 
Moreover, if one takes the pushforward of the composition of the obtained random variables with respect to $\P\x\P$, then the two constructions coincide.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
For the former, define 
\[
\pi_{\theta,y}(A_\theta\x A_y) = \int_{A_\theta} \pi_{y\given\theta}(A_y\given\theta) \d\pi_\theta(\theta)
\]
which extends to the full product $\sigma$-algebra by \Cref{lem:cyl-prod}, giving the desired probability measure.
For the latter, define the random variable
\[
\gamma : \Omega\x\Omega &\-> \Theta \x Y
&
\gamma : (\omega,\omega') &\|> (\theta(\omega), (y\given\theta)(\omega',\theta(\omega)))
\]
and take $\pi_{\theta,y} = \gamma_* (\P\x\P)$. 
We now prove these expressions coincide.
Write 
\[
\pi_{\theta,y}(A_\theta\x A_y) &= \int_{A_\theta} \pi_{y\given\theta}(A_y\given\theta) \d\pi_\theta(\theta)
\\
&= \int_\Omega\1_{\theta(\omega)\in A_\theta} \pi_{y\given\theta}(A_y\given\theta(\omega)) \d\bb{P}(\omega)
\\
&= \int_\Omega\1_{\theta(\omega)\in A_\theta} \int_\Omega \1_{(y\given\theta)(\omega',\theta(\omega)) \in A_y} \d\bb{P}(\omega') \d\bb{P}(\omega)
\\
&= \int_\Omega\int_\Omega \1_{(\theta(\omega),(y\given\theta)(\omega',\theta(\omega))) \in A_\theta \x A_y} \d\bb{P}(\omega') \d\bb{P}(\omega)
\\
&= (\P\x\P)((\theta,(y\given\theta)(\.,\theta)) \in A_\theta \x A_y)
\]
which follows using Tonelli's Theorem and \Cref{lem:cyl-prod}.
\end{proof}

These two components should be interpreted as follows: $\theta$ describes what is known about the quantity of interest external to the data, and $y\given\theta$ describes how the data $y$ relates to the quantity of interest.
More specifically, the likelihood describes how $y$ would be distributed if $\theta$ was known and equal to the conditioned value.

The condition that the pushforward of the composition of the prior and likelihood needs to be taken with respect to the product measure $\P\x\P$ should be interpreted as a kind of \emph{non-duplicate dependence} condition which ensures that $y\given\theta$ depends on $\theta$ only through its second argument, and not through the abstract random numbers $\omega$.

Given a Bayesian model, we can formalize the notion of what is \emph{learned} about $\theta$ from observing $y$ as its conditional probability distribution---note that this is meant in a \emph{distributional} sense, not a random-variable-based sense.
The formulation is given as follows.

\begin{figure}

\begin{result}[Bayes' Rule]
Suppose that $\Theta$ and $Y$ are second-countable topological spaces, and let $\pi_y = \pi_{\theta,y}(\Theta\x\.)$.
Then for every Bayesian model $\pi_{\theta,y}$ there is a $\pi_y\ae[-]$ unique probability kernel $\pi_{\theta\given y}$ satisfying
\[
\pi_{\theta,y}(A_\theta \x A_y) = \int_{A_y} \pi_{\theta\given y}(A_\theta \given y) \d\pi_y(y)
\]
which we call the \emph{posterior distribution}.
\end{result}

\begin{proof}
Apply the Disintegration Theorem.
\end{proof}

This result shows that given a Bayesian model, the posterior distribution \emph{exists}.
In its full abstract formulation, however, Bayes' Rule is \emph{non-constructive}, and it is not at all clear how to calculate any kind of useful formula from it.
Moreover, the null sets can be problematic: to ensure that $\pi_{\theta\given y}$ is defined pointwise, one needs further properties such as continuity.
Fortunately, in many settings these issues are resolved by virtue of additional structure.

The simplest such structure occurs when $\pi_{\theta,y}$ admits a density with respect to a product measure $\lambda$.
In this case, it follows \Cref{lem:ref-density} that $\pi_\theta$ admits the density $f_\theta$ with respect to $\lambda(\.\x Y)$, and similarly for $\pi_y$ and $f_y$.
Define a \emph{conditional density} as the ratio of joint and marginal densities, for instance $f_{\theta\given y} = \frac{f_{\theta,y}}{f_y}$, and let $\propto$ denote equality up to a multiplicative proportionality constant.
Then, we have the following.

\begin{proposition}[Bayes' Rule for densities]
Suppose that $\pi_{\theta,y}$ admits the density $f_{\theta,y}$ with respect to $\lambda_{\theta,y}$.
Then we have
\[
f_{\theta\given y} \propto f_{y\given\theta}f_\theta
.
\]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
We have
\[
f_{\theta,y} &= \frac{f_{\theta,y}}{f_\theta} f_\theta = f_{y\given\theta}f_\theta
&
f_{\theta,y} &= \frac{f_{\theta,y}}{f_y} f_y = f_{\theta\given y}f_y
\]
which, when combined, give the result.
\end{proof}

Sometimes, the knowledge of $f_{\theta\given y}$ up to proportionality is enough to fully deduce its form.
For example, if the likelihood is Gaussian with unknown mean and known variance, and the prior is Gaussian, then posterior is also Gaussian.
In cases such as this, where the prior and posterior land in the same parameterized class of distributions, the pair $(\pi_{y\given\theta}, \pi_\theta)$ are called \emph{conjugate}.

Bayes' Rule for densities is remarkable in its generality yet restrictiveness.
On the one hand, we require no direct assumptions about the spaces $\Theta$ and $Y$, and in particular allow for real spaces, discrete spaces, and Riemannian manifolds.
On the other hand, other than in the aforementioned settings, where we can employ the Lebesgue, counting, and Riemannian volume measures, respectively, finding a suitable reference measure can be difficult.

We will work with posterior distributions in infinite-dimensional vector spaces in the sequel---there, densities are either not available or not convenient.
In those cases, it is enough to calculate the posterior on arbitrary finite-dimensional marginal projections to uniquely determine its value on the full infinite-dimensional space.

\begin{proposition}[Conditioning and marginalization]
Conditioning and marginalization commute: given a probability measure $\pi_{\theta,\theta',y}$, if Bayes' Rule holds, then we have $\pi_y\ae[-]$ that
\[
\pi_{\theta \given y} = \pi_{\theta,\theta' \given y}(\. \x \Theta')
.
\]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let $\pi_{\theta,\theta'\given y}$ be the $\pi_y\ae[-]$ unique probability kernel given by the Disintegration Theorem satisfying
\[
\pi_{\theta,\theta',y}(A_{\theta,\theta'} \x A_y) = \int_{A_y} \pi_{\theta,\theta'\given y}(A_{\theta,\theta'} \given y) \d\pi_y(y)
.
\]
Plugging in $A_{\theta} \x \Theta'$ for $A_{\theta,\theta'}$ gives
\[
\pi_{\theta,y}(A_\theta \x A_y) = \int_{A_y} \pi_{\theta,\theta'\given y}(A_\theta \x \Theta' \given y) \d\pi_y(y)
.
\]
On the other hand, applying the Disintegration Theorem to $\pi_{\theta,y}$ gives a $\pi_y\ae[-]$ unique probability kernel satisfying
\[
\pi_{\theta,y}(A_\theta \x A_y) = \int_{A_y} \pi_{\theta\given y}(A_\theta \given y) \d\pi_y(y)
.
\]
Since both $\pi_{\theta,\theta'\given y}$ and $\pi_{\theta,y}$ are defined with respect to the same null sets, we conclude by uniqueness that they coincide, and the claim follows.
\end{proof}

This result makes densities into a substantially more powerful tool than they would be otherwise, since it enables us to use them for calculating posterior distributions even where they are not directly available.
In particular, we can map an infinite-dimensional function space into finite-dimensional vector spaces induced by pointwise function evaluations at arbitrary points, enabling us to calculate posterior distributions in such settings, in spite of no suitable densities existing directly in the space of interest.

We now introduce the \emph{variational formulation} of Bayes' Rule, which expresses the posterior as the solution to an infinite-dimensional optimization problem.

\begin{proposition}[Bayes' Rule in variational form]
\label{prop:variational-bayes}
Let $\pi_{y,\theta}$ be a Bayesian model, and assume it admits the density $f_{\theta,y}$ with respect to a product measure $\lambda$.
Then for every $\gamma\in Y$, the posterior distribution satisfies 
\[
\pi_{\theta\given y}(\.\given \gamma) = \argmin_{\bb{q}_\theta \in \c{M}_1(\Theta)} D_{\f{KL}}(\bb{q}_\theta \from \pi_\theta) - \operatorname*{\E}_{\vartheta\~\bb{q}_\theta} \ln f_{y\given\theta}(\gamma\given\vartheta)
\]
where the minima does not depend on the choice of $\lambda$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Write the quantity being minimized as
\[
D_{\f{KL}}(\bb{q}_\theta \from \pi_\theta) - \operatorname*{\E}_{\vartheta\~\bb{q}_\theta} \ln f_{y\given\theta}(\gamma\given\vartheta) &= \operatorname*{\E}_{\vartheta\~\bb{q}_\theta} \ln \frac{f_{\bb{q}}(\vartheta)}{f_\theta(\vartheta) f_{y\given\theta}(\gamma\given\vartheta)}
\\
&= \operatorname*{\E}_{\vartheta\~\bb{q}_\theta} \ln \frac{f_{\bb{q}}(\vartheta)}{f_{\theta\given y}(\vartheta\given\gamma) f_y(\gamma)}
\\
&= D_{\f{KL}}(\bb{q}_\theta \from \pi_{\theta\given y}(\.\given \gamma)) - \ln f_y(\gamma)
\]
Since $\ln f_y(\gamma)$ does not depend on $\bb{q}_\theta$, and since $D_{\f{KL}}(\mu \from \nu) = 0$ implies $\mu = \nu$, we conclude that the objective is minimized by taking $\bb{q}_\theta = \pi_{\theta\given y}(\.\given\gamma)$.
Since the minima does not depend on the choice of the measure $\lambda$ with respect to which the densities are defined, the claim follows.
\end{proof}

For any given dataset, this result shows that  Bayes' Rule can be viewed in \emph{information-theoretic} manner: among all probability measures, the posterior maximizes predictive power, while retaining as many bits as possible from the prior, in the sense given by the Kullback--Leibler divergence.

It's also possible to prove the result in a different way using the calculus of variations, with variations taken in the Banach space of signed measures under the total variation norm.
That argument also employs Bayes' Rule for densities for its key step, making it largely similar in spirit.

The result also suggests a way to approximately compute posterior distributions: restrict the optimization problem to a suitably chosen subspace of the space of all probability measures $\c{M}_1(\Theta)$.
This strategy will be particularly fruitful in the later-described setting of Gaussian processes, where techniques for constructing such approximations with well-understood and favorable accuracy will be considered.

We will \emph{always} view variational approximations as minimization of Kullback--Leibler divergences, as this is mathematically sound.
We will eschew standard presentations involving \emph{evidence lower bounds}: the only mathematical explanations for why maximizing these bounds should improve model performance that I am aware of appeal to Kullback--Leibler divergences---so, then, why talk about evidence lower bounds in the first place?

Once a posterior is calculated, the next step is to extract the relevant quantities from it.
Traditionally, this is often done by displaying summary statistics to be evaluated and interpreted by a person with statistical training, often with a focus on assessing uncertainty.
We will instead focus on settings where the posterior is given as input to an upstream decision-making algorithm: we explore these next.

\subsection{Technical lemmas}

We now prove a number of technical lemmas used in the preceding text, which for completeness are presented here in order to avoid disrupting the reader's flow.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:rcrv-rvm-equiv}
Let $b:\Omega\x A\->B$ be a jointly measurable stochastic process.
Then the map $b_*\P : \c{B} \x A \-> \R$, where the pushforward is taken in the first argument, is a probability kernel.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
It is clear that $b_* \P$ is a probability measure for all $a'\in A$, so we only need to prove that the map $a \|> (b(\.,a)_*\P)(A_b)$ is measurable for all $A_b\in\c{B}$.
First, write
\[
(b_*\P)(A_b) = \P(b(\.,a)^{-1}(A_b)) = \int_\Omega \1_{b(\omega,a)\in A_b} \d\bb{P}(\omega)
.
\]
Now, note that the map $\Omega\x A\->\R$ given by $(\omega,a) \|> \1_{b(\omega,a)\in A_b}$ is bounded measurable, since $b$ is measurable in both arguments, and indicators of measurable functions on measurable sets are bounded measurable.
Finally, since for any bounded measurable $f : \Omega \x A \-> \R$, the map $a \|> \int_\Omega f(\omega,a) \d\bb{P}(\omega)$ is measurable by Fubini's Theorem, the claim follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:semi-algebra}
Let $\c{S}$ be a \emph{semi-algebra of sets}, which is defined as a family of sets satisfying the following conditions.
\1 $\c{S}$ contains the empty set.
\2 $\c{S}$ is closed under finite intersections.
\3 The complement of any set in $\c{S}$ can be written as a finite union of disjoint sets in $\c{S}$.
\0 
Then any bounded countably additive non-negative function $\mu : \c{S} \-> \R$ satisfying $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$ extends uniquely to a measure defined on the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing $\c{S}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Define the \emph{algebra of sets} generated by $\c{S}$ to be
\[
a(\c{S}) = \cbr{\U_{i=1}^n S_i : S_i \in \c{S} \t{disjoint}}
\]
and note that the smallest $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\c{S}$ obviously coincides with the smallest $\sigma$-algebra generated by $a(\c{S})$.
We claim every function $\mu : \c{S} \-> \R$ satisfying the given assumptions extends uniquely to a function on $a(\c{S})$.
Every element of $\c{S}$ can be written as a finite union of disjoint sets---using this, define 
\[
\mu^{(a)} : a(\c{S}) &\-> \R
&
\mu^{(a)}\del{\U_{i=1}^n S_i} &= \sum_{i=1}^n \mu(S_i)
.
\]
To ensure this is well-defined, we check that the definition is independent of the choice of which disjoint subsets to take the union of---suppose that $\U_{i=1}^n S_i = \U_{j=1}^m T_j$.
Then we have $S_i = \U_{j=1}^m S_i \^ T_j$ and similarly $T_j = \U_{i=1}^n S_i \^ T_j$: plugging these in to $\mu$ yields a double sum of disjoint sets and affirms well-definedness.
Next, note that $\mu^{(a)}(\emptyset) = \mu(\emptyset) = 0$.
To see that $\mu$ inherits countable additivity, take a sequence $S_1,S_2,.. \in a(\c{S})$ and note that
\[
\U_{n=1}^\infty S_n = \U_{n=1}^\infty \U_{m=1}^n T_{nm}
\]
where $T_{nm} \in \c{S}$.
Plugging this into $\mu^{(a)}$ and applying countable additivity of $\mu$ gives the desired property.
We have thus obtained a uniquely defined countably additive function $\mu^{(a)} : a(\c{S}) \-> \R$ defined on an algebra of sets $a(\c{S})$ which extends $\mu$.
This function satisfies the assumptions of Carath√©odory's Extension Theorem---see \textcite[Theorem A1.1]{kallenberg06} or \textcite[Theorem 3.1]{billingsley08}---applying this result gives the claim, where we note that uniqueness follows since the range of $\mu^{(a)}$ is bounded.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:cyl-prod}
Let $\pi : \c{A} \x \c{B} \-> \R$ be a countably additive function with $\pi(\emptyset) = 0$.
Then $\pi$ extends uniquely to a measure on the product $\sigma$-algebra.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By \Cref{lem:semi-algebra}, it suffices to show that $\c{A} \x \c{B}$ is a semi-algebra of sets.
The first required property is immediate, the second and third properties follow by $(A \x B) \^ (A' \x B') = (A \x A') \^ (B \x B')$ and $(A \x B)^c = (A^c \x B) \u (A \x B^c) \u (A^c \x B^c)$.
The claim follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:ref-density}
Let $\pi_{a,b}$ be a measure which admits the density $f_{a,b}$ with respect to a product measure $\lambda_{a,b}$.
Then $\pi_a = \pi_{a,b}(\.\x B)$ admits the density $f_a$ with respect to $\lambda_a = \lambda_{a,b}(\.\x B)$, and similarly in the other argument.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By assumption and Tonelli's Theorem, we have 
\[
\pi_a(A_a) &= \pi_{a,b}(A_a \x B) 
\\
&= \int_{A_a \x B} f_{a,b}(\alpha,\beta) \d\lambda_{a,b}(\alpha,\beta)
\\
&= \int_{A_a} \int_B f_{a,b}(\alpha,\beta) \d\lambda_b(\beta)\d\lambda_a(\alpha) 
\\
&= \int_{A_a} f_a(\alpha) \d\lambda_a(\alpha) 
\]
where the desired probability density is $f_a(\alpha) = \int_B f_{a,b}(\alpha,\beta) \d\lambda_b(\beta)$.
\end{proof}

\section{Statistical decision-making}

We now use the Bayesian formalism to construct a probabilistic theory of decision-making.
To begin, we formalize the very general concept of an abstract agent making decisions in an environment in pursuit of some goal.

\subsection{Markov decision processes}
A Markov decision process is a stochastic system consisting of a set of states, actions, and transitions between states, together with a rewards that vary depending on states and actions.
This is defined as follows.

\begin{definition}[Discrete-time Markov decision process]
A \emph{discrete-time Markov decision process} is a $4$-tuple consisting of the following.
\1 State space: a measurable space $S$.
\2 Action space: a measurable space $A$.
\3 Reward: a probability kernel $r : \c{B}(\R) \x X \x A \-> \R$. 
\4 Transition kernel: a probability kernel $p : \c{S} \x S \x A \-> \R$.
\0 
\end{definition}

This is a very broad notion---however, a number of variations are also possible.
For instance, one can consider continuous-time, purely deterministic, and partially observed analogs---each of these involve their own subtleties and deserve study in their own right, but we do not pursue them here.

\caption{Illustration of the feedback loop induced by a Markov decision process. Here, the agent chooses an action, which results in the environment changing to a new state. The agent observes the new state, as well as the reward given by the previous state and action. The agent's goal is to select actions to maximize long-term rewards.}
\end{figure}

The idea behind this definition is that, at every point in time, the agent observes the current state, chooses an action $a \in A$, and obtains another state $s' \~ p(s\given a)$.
Note that \emph{time} can, and often will, be part of the state $s$.
The agent's goal is to choose each action so as to control the entire trajectory of states in order to obtain maximum rewards.
The choice of actions in every state is called a \emph{policy}, and is formalized as follows.

\begin{definition}[Policy]
Define the following.
\1 A measurable function $\pi : S \-> A$ is called a \emph{deterministic policy}.
\2 A probability kernel $\pi : \c{A} \x S \-> \R$ is called a \emph{Markov policy}.
\0 
\end{definition}

Markov policies include deterministic policies as a special case, by taking the conditional distributions to be Dirac and re-interpreting the given expressions appropriately.
As with Markov decision processes, here one can also consider even more general policies, but we do not do so here.

Different policies yield different state trajectories, and therefore different rewards.
Of these, some obtain more rewards than others: 

\begin{definition}[Optimal policy]
Let $T \in \N$ be the \emph{time horizon}.
A policy is called \emph{optimal} if it maximizes the \emph{value function} 
\[
V^{(\pi)}(x_0) = \E \sum_{t=0}^T r_t
\]
where $r_t \given s_t,a_t \~ r(s_t,a_t)$, $a_t \given s_t \~ \pi(s_t)$, and $s_{t+1} \given s_t,a_t \~ p(s_t, a_t)$.
\end{definition}

Finding an optimal policy therefore amounts to selecting the best possible actions to maximize expected total rewards.
Note that closely-related alternative notions of optimality, such as minimizing infinite discounted sums, or limits of averages, are also possible.
The most important distinction between different decision problems for finding optimal policies is given by what is assumed known.

\1 If $p$ and $r$ are known, we say we have an \emph{optimal control} problem.
\2 Otherwise, we say we have a \emph{reinforcement learning} problem.
\0 

These classes differ fundamentally from one another. 
Optimal control problems can be viewed as a class of structured optimization problems, where the goal is to compute $\pi$ by evaluating $r$ and $p$ as necessary.
Here, one generally proceeds by proving that $V^{(\pi)}$ and $\pi$ satisfy certain recursive equations, and developing schemes for solving them.

Reinforcement learning problems are more complex.
Due to the rewards or dynamics being \emph{unknown}, they cannot simply be maximized and their expectation must be \emph{learned}.
This forces one to consider whether to take advantage of actions known to be good, or to try others in case they might be better---this is known as the \emph{explore-exploit tradeoff}.
For such settings, we need an appropriate solution concept---to obtain one, define the following.

\begin{definition}[Regret]
The \emph{regret} of a policy $\pi$ is defined as 
\[
R^{(\pi)}(x_0) = V^*(x_0) - V^{(\pi)}(x_0)
\]
provided that the value function $V^*$ with respect to an optimal policy exists.
\end{definition}

Minimizing regret is equivalent to maximizing value, but when $p$ and $r$ are unknown doing so directly is impossible.
Instead, the goal is to find an \emph{algorithm}---that is, a way of updating the policy based on observed data---so as to limit growth of regret.

In most settings, one can prove that every algorithm which does not know $p$ and $r$ necessarily incurs some level of regret.
This is done by exhibiting a randomized set of problems and rewards over which regret is lower-bounded in expectation for any algorithm.
In such a class, actions that perform well on one problem will necessarily perform badly on another problem.
Such arguments show that some degree of regret is inevitable.

On the other hand, some algorithms incur more regret than others.
The obviously-bad algorithm which learns nothing and chooses the exact same action over and over again incurs at most linear regret.
An algorithm is said to \emph{solve} a decision problem if its asymptotic regret rate with respect to $T$ matches the respective regret lower bound in the given problem class.
Finding such algorithms is of key interest.

One way to construct algorithms for solving decision problems is to employ a \emph{model-based} approach, which loosely speaking works as follows.

\1 Learn the unknown transitions and/or rewards from observed data using a supervised learning approach.
\2 Use the learned model(s) to find policy satisfying some criteria.
\0 

The details of such approaches depends on the setting.
We distinguish between two key kinds of reinforcement learning problems.

\1 If $|S| = 1$, it is known as a \emphmarginnote{multi-armed bandit} problem.
\2 Otherwise, it is known as a general reinforcement learning problem.
\0 

Multi-armed bandits possess no variable state, and thus only require one to learn the rewards and determine which actions are optimal.
In general reinforcement learning, actions can influence transitions between states---these problems require long-term planning, making them much more general, difficult, and important.
I believe that as a mathematical theory, reinforcement learning is powerful enough to describe many aspects of human and animal intelligence, making it fundamentally interesting to study and develop.

We now restrict ourselves to the bandit setting, which is substantially easier to study and so can be understood much more deeply.
Here, even when $A$ is a finite set and the rewards are Gaussian, the model-based approach consisting of (i) estimating rewards using empirical risk minimization and (ii) choosing the policy which maximizes rewards is known to be non-optimal.
This approach fails to explore, and can get stuck chasing sub-optimal rewards.

One way to fix this problem is to replace empirical risk minimization with Bayesian learning, and adopt an appropriate decision rule for selecting actions.
Doing this yields approaches which can be shown optimal in many settings.
We therefore proceed to study multi-armed bandits in more detail.

\subsection{Multi-armed bandits}

The multi-armed bandit problem takes its name from a casino analogy.
In the 1950s, slot machines often had levers one could pull instead of buttons one could press, and were called \emph{one-armed bandits} for their ability to empty gamblers' wallets.
A \emph{multi-armed bandit} is a slot machine, which, for a fixed cost, allows one to pull an arm $x \in X$ and receive a random reward whose distribution depends on $x$.
The goal is to minimize  expected loss, or, equivalently, maximize total expected rewards.

Multi-armed bandits can be viewed as discrete-time Markov decision processes with a one-element state space, but this is not necessarily the most fruitful way to think about them.
We thus begin by introducing formalism and notation better suited to the given setting, which can be viewed as special cases of the notions considered previously.

\caption{Here, we illustrate a simple three-armed bandit. 
Each of the three arms has its own reward distribution, shown on the left.
These are unknown to the agent, which only sees the rewards obtained by actions it takes, shown in the center, and must the obtained information to decide which arm to pick.
Each arm's regret is given by its expected decrease in reward compared to the optimal arm, shown on the right.}
\end{figure}

\begin{definition}[Multi-armed bandit]
Let $f : X \-> \R$ be bounded above function, let $\eps : \Omega \x X \-> \R$ be a stochastic process such that $\E(\eps(x)) = 0$, and let $y(\omega,x) = f(x) + \eps(\omega,x)$.
Define the following.
\1 We say that the Markov decision process $(\{1\},X,y_*\P,\delta_{1})$, with $\delta_1$ defined below, is a \emph{multi-armed bandit}.
\2 We say that a probability kernel  $\pi : \c{X} \x \bigoplus_{n=1}^\infty (X \x \R)^n \-> \R$ is a \emph{multi-armed bandit algorithm}.
\0
Here, $\delta_1$ is the Dirac measure centered at $1$ for all actions $x\in X$, which is the only possible conditional probability distribution over a one-element set, and $\bigoplus$ denotes the disjoint union of measurable spaces.
\end{definition}

An algorithm, then, assigns every dataset of arbitrary size to a probability measure describing what arms should be picked with what probability.
Each dataset consists of $(x, y)$ pairs where $x$ are the locations chosen by the algorithm, and $y$ are the noisy observed values---recall $\omega$ is the randomness used by the noise.
Some algorithms maximize $f$ faster than others---we consider this next.


\begin{definition}[Regret]
For a given multi-armed bandit, let $f(x^*)$ be the global maxima of $f$. 
Define the \emph{regret} of an algorithm $\pi$ at time $T$ to be
\[
R(\omega,T) = \sum_{t=1}^T f(x^*) - f(x_t(\omega))
\]
where $x_t \~ \pi(y_0,..,y_{t-1})$, $y_t(\omega) = f(x_t) + \eps_t(\omega)$, and $\eps_t \~ \eps(\.,x_t)$.
\end{definition}

Regret thus counts the total reward lost by virtue of not knowing the optimal arm in advance.
Algorithms which achieve small regret therefore learn the optimal rewards effectively, and avoid getting stuck pulling bad arms.

Regret behavior in multi-armed bandit problems is strongly dependent on properties of the underlying function $f$, and in particular its domain $X$.
It is clear by considering for instance $X = \R$ that if $X$ is too large or too unstructured, no algorithm achieves better than linear regret.
We therefore begin studying the simplest non-trivial domain class.

\begin{definition}[$K$-armed bandit]
We say that a multi-armed bandit defined over a finite set with cardinality $K=|X|$ is a \emph{$K$-armed bandit}.
Moreover, if $y(\.,x)$ is a Bernoulli random variable for all $x$, we say it is a \emph{Bernoulli bandit}.
\end{definition}

For such bandits, regret can be decomposed on a per-arm basis in the manner given as follows.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:regret-arms}
Regret satisfies 
\[
R(\omega,T) = \sum_{x=1}^K \Delta(x) n_T(\omega,x)
\]
where $n_T(\omega,x) = \sum_{t=1}^T \1_{x_t(\omega) = x}$ and $\Delta(x) = f(x^*) - f(x)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Follows directly from definition by grouping terms in the sum.
\end{proof}

What kind of performance is possible on such a problem?
One can ask and answer this question as follows.

\begin{theorem}
For any algorithm defined over a class of $K$-armed bandits there is an $f$ such that
\[
\E(R(\.,T)) \geq \Omega(\sqrt{KT})
.
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We prove there is a class of random functions $f$ over which every algorithm achieves high regret in expectation, and hence a high-regret $f$ must exist.
TODO.
\end{proof}

This tells us that regret is necessarily incurred as consequence of not knowing the expected rewards of each arm given by $f$.
The next step, then, is to ask: is there an algorithm which achieves this rate?
We first consider simply evaluating each arm once, and then making choices according to the empirical averages.

\begin{proposition}
For a Bernoulli bandit, the algorithm which chooses actions by first trying each arm out once, and then selecting arms according to the maximum empirical average
\[
x_{t+1} &= \argmax_{x\in X} \mu_t(x)
&
\mu_t(x) &= \frac{\sum_{t=1}^T \1_{y_t = 1} \1_{x_t = x}}{\sum_{t=1}^T \1_{x_t = x}}
\]
of the random observed data achieves linear regret.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
For an event $S$, we may write
\[
\E(R(\.,T)) &= \E(R(\.,T) \given S) \P(S) + \E(R(\.,T) \given S^c) \P(S^c) 
\\
&\geq \E(R(\.,T) \given S) \P(S)
.
\]
So, it suffices to exhibit a bandit along with an event $S$, which we call the \emph{stuck event}, which occurs with constant probability and induces linear regret.
Let $S$ be the event that during the initial first arm pulls, the optimal arm yields zero reward, while some other arm yields a reward: clearly $\P(S) > 0$.
On the other hand, $\E(R(\.,T) \given S) = \c{O}(T)$, because the optimal arm conditional on $S$ has empirical mean zero, which is always smaller than the alternative, and will never be selected again.
The claim follows.
\end{proof}

This algorithm therefore fails to resolve the explore-exploit tradeoff, and gets stuck with suboptimal choices.
While the setup is obviously contrived---for instance, giving each arm some non-zero selection probability even if it previously gave bad rewards would seemingly break our lower bound---it also illustrates an important principle: the algorithm must explore.
The question, then, is how should it explore?
As an alternative, consider a conjugate model with a simple uncertainty-based decision rule for selecting arms.

\begin{definition}[Hoeffding--UCB algorithm]
Define the \emph{Hoeffding upper confidence bound} algorithm which tries each arm once, and then, for a total of $T$ rounds, selects actions by
\[
x_{t+1} &= \argmax_{x\in X} f^+_t(x) 
&
f^+_t(x) &= \mu_t(x) + c_t\sigma_t(x)
\]
where $\mu_t$ are the empirical means, $\sigma_t(x) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_t(x)}}$, and $c_t = \sqrt{2\ln(T)}$.
\end{definition}

Note that here, again, no $\omega$-arguments are present in the notation because randomness only enters through the observed data.
We now consider this algorithm's regret.
It turns out this simple modification, consisting of adding a set of error bars with a threshold growing in time and decreasing with data, is enough to result in different regret behavior.

\begin{theorem}
Hoeffding--UCB achieves an expected regret of
\[
\E(R(T)) \leq \tl{\c{O}}\del{\sqrt{KT}}
\]
uniformly for all $f$, where $\tl{\c{O}}$ denotes asymptotics up to logarithmic factors.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
First, let $B$ denote the event that the \emph{bound holds}, namely $f^-_t(x) \leq f(x) \leq f^+_t(x)$ for all $x\in X$ and all $t \leq T$, where $f^-_t(x) = \mu_t(x) - c_t \sigma_t(x)$. 
Under this event, the upper confidence bound is a true bound on the rewards.
Then 
\[
\E(R(T)) &= \E(R(T) \given B) \P(B) + \E(R(T) \given B^c) \P(B^c)
\\
&\leq \E(R(T) \given B) + T \P(B^c)
\]
since $\P(B) \leq 1$, and a regret of $T$ is the maximum possible value as there are $T$ rounds and rewards are in $[0,1]$.
Our strategy will be to bound $\E(R(T) \given B)$, while choosing the scaling factor $c_t$ in the width of the upper confidence bound to ensure that $\P(B^c)$ decays fast enough that the latter term is negligible.
We begin with the latter.
By the union bound, we have
\[
\P(B^c) &\leq \sum_{t=1}^T \sum_{x\in X} \P(p_x \leq f^-_t(x)) + \P(p_x \geq f^+_t(x))
\\
&= 2KT \max_{\substack{x\in X\\1 \leq t \leq T}} \P(p_x \geq f^+_t(x))
\]
where $p_x$ is the Bernoulli parameter for arm $x$, and we have used symmetry of our error bars, which we recall are defined using the standard deviation, to combine terms.
For each $n > 0$, the probability we want to bound is
\[
\P\del{p_x \geq \frac{y}{n} + \sqrt{\frac{2\ln(T)}{n}}} \leq \exp\del{-2 \del{\sqrt{\frac{2\ln(T)}{n}}}^2 n} = \frac{1}{T^4}
\]
using Hoeffding's inequality.
Since holds uniformly in $n$, it follows that
\[
\P(p_x \geq f^+_t(x)) = \P\del{p_x \geq \frac{y}{n_t(x)} + \sqrt{\frac{2\ln(T)}{n_t(x)}}} \leq \frac{1}{T^4}
\]
We therefore conclude that 
\[
T\P(B^c) \leq \frac{2KT}{T^4} = \c{O}(1)
\]
which shows that the upper confidence bounds are exceeded sufficiently rarely that this possibility incurs no regret in the asymptotic limit, and completes this part of the argument.
We now proceed to analyze the $\E(R(T) \given B)$ term---assume henceforth that $B$ holds.
We have that 
\[
\Delta(x_t) &= f(x^*) - f(x_t)
\\
&\leq f^+_t(x^*) - f^-_t(x_t)
\\
&\leq f^+_t(x_t) - f^-_t(x_t)
\\
&= 2\sigma_t(x_t)
\]
using the definition of the event $B$.
Now, if we consider the rescaled error bar width $c_t\sigma_t(x_t)$ of the arm chosen at time $t$, this is
\[
\Delta(x_t) \leq \c{O}(c_t\sigma_t(x_t)) = \tl{\c{O}}\del{\frac{1}{\sqrt{n_t}}}
.
\]
By \Cref{lem:regret-arms}---which we note still holds conditional on $B$ via the exact same argument---we have
\[
\E(R(T)\given B) &= \sum_{x=1}^K \Delta(x) n_T(x) 
\\
&\leq \sum_{x=1}^K \tl{\c{O}}\del{\sqrt{n_T(x)}}
\\
&\leq \tl{\c{O}}\del{\sqrt{K} \sqrt{\sum_{x\in X} n_T(X)}}
\\
&= \tl{\c{O}}\del{\sqrt{KT}}
\]
which completes the argument.
\end{proof}

This shows that the proposed algorithm, which uncertainty built via the error bars, effectively balances exploration and exploitation in this setting.
The above behavior is not unique to the given form of the upper confidence bound, nor to the upper confidence bound rule itself.
For example, we can consider a variation of the above algorithm, where the width of the error bars is constructed via a Bayesian model.

\begin{definition}[Beta--Bernoulli--UCB algorithm]
Define a Bayesian model via the likelihood $\gamma(x) \~[Ber](\mu(x))$ and prior $\mu(x) \~[Beta](a,b)$.
Define the \emph{beta--Bernoulli upper confidence bound} algorithm which selects actions by maximizing the function
\[
x_{t+1} &= \argmax_{x\in X} f^+_t(x) 
&
f^+_t(x) &= \mu_t(x) + c_t \sigma_t(x)
\]
where $(\mu_t, \sigma_t)$ are the mean and standard deviation of the posterior distribution $\mu\given\gamma(x_1) = y_1, .., \gamma(x_t) = y_t$. and $c_t$ is defined as previously.
\end{definition}

One can show this algorithm achieves the same regret as Hoeffding--UCB: the proof is similar, but instead uses the empirical Bernstein inequality, and is significantly more messy owing to the complicated form of the posterior mean and standard deviation.
Even more generally, one can select arms by optimizing a function $\alpha : X \-> \R$, called an \emph{acquition function}, built from a posterior distribution, confidence set, or other appropriate construction.
Many different acquisition functions have been proposed.

We have made no attempt to optimize the bound, and significant improvements are possible, particularly when considering variations of the UCB algorithm.
Of these, algorithms built using \emph{confidence sets} rather than posterior distributions, such as the closely-related Hoeffding--UCB algorithm, are particularly important in the $K$-armed bandit setting.
We focus on the Bayesian view because it generalizes well to more complex settings.

\caption{The idea behind the UCB algorithm is to use the observed data to construct a set of error bars that reflect what has been learned about the mean rewards.
Here, we construct these using the posterior distribution under a Gaussian prior and likelihood.
The next arm is chosen as the maximum of the quantile-based error bars.
This process is repeated iteratively as additional data is obtained, with the quantile becoming more strict over time, ensuring the bounds hold increasingly often.}
\end{figure}

We now proceed to explore a more general setting which will enable us to employ the ideas developed so far to develop efficient black-box optimization algorithms.
This will enable us to use Bayesian methods to solve a broad class of decision problems of practical interest.

\subsection{Bayesian optimization}
\label{sec:bayesian-optimization}

We now describe a formalism for using ideas built on Bayesian learning and multi-armed bandits for designing global optimization algorithms.
Our goal now is to minimize a black-box function
\[
f : X \-> \R    
\]
which is assumed continuous, and defined on a closed compact set $X \subseteq \R^d$.
Such a function is automatically bounded.
Our goal is to minimize $f$ with as few evaluations as possible.

To measure performance, we will again introduce a notion of regret.
Define
\[
R(T) = \sum_{t=1}^T f(x_t) - f(x^*)    
\]
where we have used the opposite sign convention compared to bandits and reinforcement learning, because our goal is to minimize $f$ rather than maximizing rewards.
Note that unlike before, for a deterministic algorithm this is now a purely deterministic quantity, and not a random variable.

As before, we can approach this problem by building a Bayesian model.
For an arbitrary sequence of points $x_1,..,x_t$, define the likelihood
\[
y_t(\omega) &= f(x_t) + \eps_t(\omega)
&
\eps_t &\~[N](0,\sigma^2)
.
\]
Here, the space of observed values is $Y = \R^n$, and our quantity of interest is the actual \emph{function} $f$, which we view as an element of an infinite-dimensional vector space, say, for instance, the space of continuous functions $C^0(X;\R)$.

\caption{Bayesian optimization using Thompson sampling. 
Here, we sample a random function from the posterior distribution over possible functions, and choose the next evaluation point to be the minima of the sampled random function. 
As additional data is obtained, the posterior distribution concentrates around the true function. 
Unlike the upper confidence bound acquisition function considered previously, Thompson sampling makes use of a full probability distribution, rather than just a set of error bars.}
\end{figure}


It is now clear why we bothered with setting up a dense, abstract formalism for Bayesian learning in general measure spaces: this formalism is rich and powerful enough to enable us to properly define priors on spaces like this---we explore these in the sequel.
Suppose for the moment that this is possible.
Then, we can calculate the posterior distribution
\[
f \given y_1,..,y_t
\]
which is now a probability measure supported on $C^0(X;\R)$.
To determine the next point to query, we introduce and maximize an acquisition function.
Typical acquisition functions include the \emph{upper confidence bound} acquisition function considered previously, as well as \emph{Thompson sampling}
\[
x_{t+1}(\omega) &= \argmin_{x\in X} \phi_t(\omega,x)
&
\phi_t&\~ f \given y_1,..,y_t
\]
which is a \emph{random} acquisition function, and \emph{expected improvement}
\[
x_{t+1} = \argmax_{x\in X} \E \max(0,f_t(\.,x) - f(x^*_t))
\]
where $f_t = f \given y_1,..,y_t$ is the posterior, and $x^*_t = \argmin_{t \in \{1,..,t\}} f(x_t)$ is the smallest value observed so far.
Many other effective acquisition functions, including \emph{probability of improvement}, \emph{predictive entropy search}, and \emph{information directed sampling}, are also possible.

Regret analysis for all of these choices is possible, and will in general depend on the detailed properties on the model, acquisition function, and the unknown function $f$.
In particular, regularity and smoothness properties may play a role, as well as structure present in the domain $X$.
In settings where the function $f$ is unknown, it's also possible to analyze the expression 
\[
BR(T) = \E \sum_{t=1}^T f(\omega,x_t) - f(\omega,x^*(\omega))    
\]
where minima and regret are now considered in expectation with respect to the prior---this is called the \emph{Bayesian regret}.
Some acquisition functions, such as Thompson sampling, admit particularly simple analyses in this setting.

This concludes our development and showcasing of decision-making algorithms.
We now proceed to develop the final piece of the puzzle not yet studied in detail: how to place priors on function spaces, in order to build Bayesian models for settings such as Bayesian optimization.

\section{Gaussian processes}

In the preceding section, considerations arising from Bayesian decision-making algorithms motivated us to find a way to place priors on spaces of functions $f : X \-> \R$.
Gaussian processes are a broad class of random functions capable of this: to develop them, however, we will need to start with simpler notions and gradually work towards increasing levels of generality.
Such processes are defined by the key property that no matter what angle one views them from, they yield Gaussian marginal distributions.

The notion of a Gaussian process as a random function will turn out to be too restrictive for our settings of interest: it is not possible to view certain random variables, which do deserve to be called Gaussian processes, in this way.
The obstructions can be geometric or analytic in nature.
For example, a vector field on a manifold is not a vector-valued continuous function, it is a section of a vector bundle: what, then, should the term \emph{Gaussian} actually mean?
Difficulties also occur when considering white noise processes.

To handle these issues, we will develop the notion of a Gaussian process $f : \Omega \-> V$ where $V$ is a real vector space equipped with additional structure arising from the setting at hand.
Gaussian process are fundamentally \emph{linear} objects which reflect this structure.
The simplest settings arise when $V$ is smallest.

\1  Choosing $V = \{0\}$ to be the trivial vector space, there is exactly one $V$-valued random variable, whose distribution is the Dirac measure centered at $0$, which can trivially be called Gaussian.
This random variable is not very interesting, so we do not consider it further.
\2 Choosing $V = \R$ to coincide with the underlying scalar field yields the setting of \emph{Gaussian random variables}.
This is the next-simplest setting and the first one we explore in detail.
\3 Choosing $V = \R^d$ yields the setting of \emph{Gaussian random vectors}, whose components are multivariate Gaussian---or, equivalently, whose \emph{dot products} are scalar-valued Gaussian.
\4 Choosing $V$ to be a space of functions $f : X \-> \R$ yields the setting of Gaussian processes, whose finite-dimensional marginals are multivariate Gaussian.
This setting is well-studied when $X$ is itself a Euclidean space: in \Cref{ch:noneuclidean}, we will examine cases where $X$ instead possesses various kinds of geometric structure.
\5 Finally, choosing $V$ to be a possibly infinite-dimensional vector space, such as a Banach of Hilbert space---this yields the most general setting we examine.
This level of generality will be important for two reasons: (i) to provide a formalism for studying stochastic partial differential equations, and (ii) to develop a coordinate-free notion of Gaussian random vectors that will be useful in the differential-geometric setting.
\0 

In what follows, our goal will be to lay the groundwork for subsequent development.
Thus, we will not discuss Bayesian learning with Gaussian processes, which will instead be presented in \Cref{ch:pathwise}.
We proceed to examine the scalar case.

\subsection{Gaussian random variables}

A Gaussian random variable is a map which takes in an abstract random number, and returns a real scalar.
The basic object from which other Gaussians will be constructed is the standard scalar Gaussian, defined as follows.

\begin{definition}[Standard Gaussian random variable]
A random variable $z : \Omega\->\R$ is called \emph{standard Gaussian} if it admits the Lebesgue density
\[
f(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\del{-\frac{z^2}{2}}
.
\]
\end{definition}

From this, we define general scalar Gaussians.

\begin{definition}[Gaussian random variable]
A random variable $y : \Omega\->\R$ is called \emph{Gaussian} if there are scalars $\mu, \sigma\in\R$, and a standard Gaussian $z$, such that
\[
y = \sigma z + \mu
.
\]
\end{definition}


\begin{figure}
\input{figures/tex/norm-dist.tex}
\caption{Probability density functions for a set of Gaussian random variables, each with different mean and standard deviation parameters. All of these can be obtained by shifting and rescaling any of the others via affine transformations.}
\end{figure}

Note that we do \emph{not} require $\sigma \geq 0$: hence, every Gaussian random variable is determined uniquely in 
distribution by the pair $(\mu,\sigma^2)$, which we call its \emph{mean} and \emph{variance}, respectively. 
We write $y \~[N](\mu,\sigma^2)$.
True to these parameter names, we have
\[
\E(y) &= \mu
&
\E\del{(y - \mu)^2} &= \sigma^2
.
\]
A Gaussian random variable is called \emph{centered} if $\mu = 0$.
For a given variance $\sigma^2$ and standard Gaussian $z$, the expressions $\sigma z$ and $-\sigma z$ define two \emph{different} centered Gaussians with the same distribution.
At this stage, pointing these distinctions may appear needlessly pedantic: they will become more pronounced and important once we consider more general objects.
The density of a Gaussian random variable, if it exists, takes on a form analogous to that of a standard Gaussian, namely
\[
f(y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} \exp\del{-\frac{(y-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
.
\]
Note that the density will not exist if $\sigma^2 = 0$: the distributions of such Gaussians are Dirac measures centered at $\mu$.
By examining this density, one sees that Gaussian random variables respect the additive and multiplicative structures of the reals.

\begin{proposition}[Affine maps between Gaussians]
Let $y \~[N](\mu,\sigma^2)$.
Then for $a,b \in \R$ we have that
\[
a y + b \~[N](a\mu+b, a^2\sigma^2)
.
\]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Immediate by definition.
\end{proof}

This compatibility with linear structure will be true at all levels of generality we consider.
We now lift this definition to construct multivariate analogs.

\subsection{Gaussian random vectors}

A multivariate Gaussian random vector is a random variable taking values in $\R^d$.
We write vectors defined in $\R^d$ in bold italics to emphasize this distinction, and similarly distinguish matrices from linear maps by writing the former in bold upface letters.
As before, we begin by defining a standard Gaussian.

\begin{definition}[Standard multivariate Gaussian]
A random variable $\v{z} : \Omega\->\R^d$ is called \emph{standard multivariate Gaussian} if if its distribution is the product measure of the distributions of $d$ standard Gaussians.
\end{definition}

Once the notion of a standard Gaussian is available, we can again define multivariate Gaussians as transformations of standard Gaussians.

\begin{definition}[Multivariate Gaussian]
A random variable $\v{y} : \Omega\->\R^d$ is called \emph{multivariate Gaussian} if there is a vector $\v\mu\in\R^d$, matrix $\m{L}\in\R^{d\x d}$, and standard multivariate Gaussian $\v{z}$, such that
\[
\v{y} = \m{L}\v{z} + \v\mu
.
\]
\end{definition}


\begin{figure}
\vspace*{10ex}
[Multivariate Gaussian 3D Visual]
\vspace*{10ex}
\caption{Two multivariate Gaussian densities, in dimension two, with unit variances and different correlation coefficients $\rho$. As $|\rho| \to 1$, the individual components of the multivariate Gaussian become more and more dependent.}
\end{figure}

Every multivariate Gaussian is determined by its \emph{mean vector} $\v\mu$ and positive semi-definite \emph{covariance matrix} $\m\Sigma = \m{L}\m{L}^T$, and, as before, is called \emph{centered} if $\v\mu = \v{0}$.
We write $\v{y}\~[N](\v\mu,\m\Sigma)$.
We can obtain a centered multivariate Gaussian with a given distribution by calculating a \emph{matrix square root} of $\m\Sigma$, multiplying it with a standard Gaussian.
Just as before, we have
\[
\E(\v{y}) &= \v\mu    
&
\Cov(\v{y}) &= \E\del{(\v{y}-\v\mu)(\v{y}-\v\mu)^T} = \m\Sigma
\]
and, if the determinant $|\m\Sigma|$ is non-zero,
\[
f(\v{y}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^d|\m\Sigma|}} \exp\del{-\frac{1}{2}(\v{y}-\v\mu)^T\m\Sigma^{-1}(\v{y}-\v\mu)}
\]
which now might not exist even if the distribution of $\v{y}$ is not Dirac.
In such cases, one can see that at least some eigenvalues of $\m\Sigma$ must be zero, and so Gaussians which do not admit densities must, when viewed in an appropriate basis, be products of Dirac measures with Gaussians which do admit densities.
Already in the multivariate case, then, we see the technical power of densities weakening: this will become more pronounced as we consider more general settings.
Affine maps, however, behave as before.

\begin{proposition}[Affine maps between multivariate~Gaussians]
Let $\v{y}\~[N](\v\mu,\m\Sigma)$. Then for $\m{A}\in\R^{d\x d}$ and $\v{b}\in\R^d$ we have 
\[
\m{A} \v{y} + \v{b} \~[N](\m{A}\v\mu + \v{b}, \m{A}\m\Sigma\m{A}^T)
.
\]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Immediate by definition.
\end{proof}

We now pause and reflect.
First, we distinguish $\R^d$ from a generic $d$-dimensional vector space: the former comes with a product structure $\R^d = \R \x .. \x \R$, including projection maps onto each coordinate, which in turn induce a \emph{canonical} choice of inner product given by the Euclidean dot product.
A generic finite-dimensional vector space lacks this structure: it admits many different inner products, and provides for no canonical choice.

With this in mind, we observe that we have not actually used the product structure of $\R^d$: suppose that $V$ is a finite-dimensional inner product space, and define
\[
y(\omega)  &= \sum_{i=1}^d z_i(\omega)  e_i
&
z_i \~[N](0,1)
\]
where $e_i$ is any orthonormal basis.
By noting that the choice of basis $e_i$ induces a Borel isomorphism $V \isom \R^d$, it is easy to see that this definition is basis-independent, since linear maps associated with changes of orthonormal bases are represented by orthogonal matrices.
This expression therefore defines a standard Gaussian with respect to the given inner product.

\end{subfigure}
\caption{Quantile ellipsoids for two multivariate Gaussian densities in dimension two with unit variances, different correlation coefficients $\rho$, and quantile levels equal to $0.8$, $0.95$, and $0.99$.}
\end{figure}

Subtle difference such as the ones considered become increasingly important in the sequel.
Therefore, we introduce an alternative definition to help build intuition for later.

\begin{definition}[Multivariate Gaussian (duality)]
A random variable $\v{y} : \Omega \-> \R^d$ is called \emph{multivariate Gaussian} if, for any vector $\v\phi \in \R^d$, the Euclidean dot product 
\[
\dualprod{\v\phi}{\v{y}} : \Omega \-> \R 
\]
is univariate Gaussian.
\end{definition}

This definition turns out to be equivalent to the original one.

\begin{proposition}
The notions of multivariate Gaussians in the sense of transformations and in the sense of duality coincide.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Since the dot product is a linear map, it is clear that multivariate Gaussians in the sense of transformations are also Gaussian in the sense of duality.
To see the other direction, consider unit vectors $\v\phi$ where all coordinates except one are zero. 
By using dot products with such vectors to reassemble the mean vector and covariance matrix, one sees that the claim follows from eigenvalue factorization of positive semi-definite matrices.
\end{proof}

This definition allows one to begin imagining what a substantially more general notion of Gaussianity might look like: dot products become linear functionals, and covariance matrices become bilinear forms.
The preceding argument even suggests that such random vectors can be studied using spectral theory.
Of course, in infinite-dimensional settings, topological and analytic considerations come into play, making theory more difficult.
We develop these ideas in the sequel, but first consider a simpler setting.




\subsection{Gaussian random functions}

We now consider Gaussian random functions, which are the first notion of a Gaussian random variable that is generally called a \emph{Gaussian process}.
Here, we will adopt a \emph{bottom-up} view which, from a technical perspective, departs somewhat from the notions introduced so far.

Recall that for a set $X$, an $\R$-valued \emphmarginnote{stochastic process} is a map $f : \Omega \x X \-> \R$ measurable in its first argument.
If we have a set of points $x_1,..,x_n \in X$, we can plug them into $f$ to obtain a map $(f(\.,x_1),..,f(\.,x_n)) : \Omega \-> \R^n$, which, by virtue of being a product of measurable maps, is a random variable.
We call its distribution a \emphmarginnote{finite-dimensional marginal distribution}.
Using this notion, we define Gaussian processes.

\begin{definition}[Gaussian process (stochastic process)]
Let $X$ be a set. 
A random process $f: \Omega \x X \-> \R$ is called a \emph{Gaussian process} if, for any finite set of points $x_1,..,x_n \in X$, the random variable $(f(\.,x_1),..,f(\.,x_n)) : \Omega \-> \R^n$ is multivariate Gaussian.
\end{definition}

\end{subfigure}
\caption{Random functions generated from Gaussian processes with four different covariance kernels, which differ in particular according to their regularity, ranging from nowhere-differentiable in the exponential case to infinitely-differentiable in the squared exponential case.}
\end{figure}

Immediately upon writing this definition, one is left to wonder: does it actually make sense?
In particular, do Gaussian processes in the sense given here exist?

Under general conditions on the finite-dimensional marginals, Kolmogorov's Consistency Theorem states that there exists a unique probability measure on the cylindrical $\sigma$-algebra whose finite-dimensional projections coincide with the distributions of the random variables written above.
Thus, Gaussian processes exist so long as a family of multivariate Gaussians satisfying the conditions of Kolmogorov's Consistency Theorem can be found.

The same results also allow us to reinterpret Gaussian processes as \emph{function-valued random variables}, which, in many ways, are a much more natural point of view to take.
Define $\R^X = \{f : X \-> \R\}$ equip it with the cylindrical $\sigma$-algebra to make it into a measurable space. 
Let $V \subseteq \R^X$, and let $\c{V}$ be the subset $\sigma$-algebra.\footnote{TODO: check me}

\begin{definition}[Gaussian process (random function)]
Let $X$ be a set. 
A random variable $f: \Omega \-> V \subseteq \R^X$ is called a \emph{Gaussian process} if, for any finite set of points $x_1,..,x_n \in X$, the random variable $(f(\.)(x_1),..,f(\.)(x_n)) : \Omega \-> \R^n$ is multivariate Gaussian.
\end{definition}

It is clear that every Gaussian process in the random process sense induces a Gaussian process in the random variable sense, and vice versa.
Thus, these two notions are simply two different ways of viewing the same object.

We can then ask, what properties of multivariate Gaussians are still true in this setting?
Since a Gaussian process is uniquely determined by its finite-dimensional marginals, we need to find functions that generate a family of mean vectors and covariance matrices which are positive semi-definite.
The former is straightforward: every function $\mu : X \-> \R$ can be evaluated at a finite set of points $x_1,..,x_n$ to obtain a mean vector $\v\mu = \mu(x_1,..,x_n)$.
The latter requires only slightly more thinking.

\begin{definition}[Positive semi-definite kernel]
A symmetric function $k : X \x X \-> \R$ is called a \emph{positive semi-definite kernel} if, for any finite set of points $x_1,..,x_n\in X$, the kernel matrix
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
k(x_1,x_1) & \dots &k(x_1,x_n)
\\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots 
\\
k(x_n,x_1) & \dots & k(x_n,x_n)
\end{bmatrix}
\]
is positive semi-definite.
\end{definition}

We can recover such a kernel from a given Gaussian process.

\begin{definition}[Covariance kernel]
The \emph{covariance kernel} of a Gaussian process is defined by
\[
k(x,x') = \Cov(f(\.,x),f(\.,x'))    
.
\]
\end{definition}

It is then clear that the pair $(\mu,k)$ uniquely define a Gaussian process, and so we write $f\~[GP](\mu,k)$.
Defining a centered Gaussian process then amounts to defining a positive semi-definite kernel. 

In the Euclidean case, this can be done straightforwardly by noting that (i) the linear kernel $k(x,x') = \innerprod{x}{x'}$ is positive semi-definite by non-degeneracy of the inner product, (ii) that sums, powers, and limits of positive semi-definite kernels as positive semi-definite.
By this technique, we see that the widely-used exponential and squared exponential kernels are positive semi-definite.

Since $V \subseteq \R^X$ is a space of functions, we can define addition and scalar multiplication, thereby making $V$ into a vector space.
If we do so, then, as before, affine maps preserve Gaussianity.

\begin{proposition}[Affine maps between Gaussian processes]
Let $f\~[GP](\mu, k)$, and let $W \subseteq \R^X$ be a vector space.
If $\c{A} : V \-> W$ is a measurable linear map, and $b \in W$, then $\c{A} f + b$ is a Gaussian process.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The corresponding statement holds for all finite-dimensional marginals, where linear maps become matrices. Hence, the claim follows.
\end{proof}

This is a substantially weaker assertion than previously: though we can conclude that affine maps of Gaussian processes are Gaussian, for a generic affine map we cannot immediately determine the form of the resulting kernel.
Moreover, the condition $W \subseteq \R^X$ is unnatural: by supposing it, we have more-or-less \emph{assumed} the resulting kernel to exist.
The problem here is that the notion of a \emph{kernel} is too rigid to permit a broad statement---an analogous property will hold if this is replaced with a different notion of covariance.

The situation for the other properties considered previously is even worse.
In particular, it is clear that, as an infinite-dimensional object, $f$ does not admit a probability density analogous to the ones considered previously, because an infinite-dimensional Lebesgue measure, in the sense of a locally finite translation invariant measure, does not exist.
It is also not clear what a \emph{standard} Gaussian process, nor what the analog of a matrix square root of a positive semi-definite kernel, might be.

The loss of these technical tools has consequences on what can be said about Gaussian processes.
In \Cref{ch:noneuclidean}, we will study Gaussian processes whose set $X$ is a Riemannian manifold.
In that setting, one cannot begin by proving positive semi-definiteness of linear kernels, because there is simply no useful analog of this concept.
Defining positive semi-definite kernels there turns out to be non-trivial, and the kernels we study do not admit simple expressions like they do in the Euclidean case.

We therefore proceed to adopt a function-analytic perspective which is more technical, but significantly more powerful, and will allow us to recover the previous set of tools in a much more pure and abstract form.

\subsection{Gaussian processes in the sense of duality}
\label{sec:abstract-gp}

In the preceding section, we established a notion of a \emph{Gaussian process}, generalizing the notion of Gaussianity to random functions.
In developing this viewpoint, some of the appeal of Gaussianity was lost: in particular, unlike in the finite-dimensional setting, no simple covariance kernel transformation rule was available.
Here, we consider an alternative function-analytic view which avoids these difficulties at cost of a higher degree of abstraction.


\begin{definition}[Gaussian process (duality)]
Let $V$ and $W$ be a pair of measurable real vector spaces equipped with a jointly measurable non-degenerate bilinear form $\dualprod{\.}{\.} : V \x W \-> \R$.
We say that a random variable $f : \Omega \-> V$ is a \emph{Gaussian process in the sense of duality} if, for any $\phi \in W$, the scalar-valued random variable $\dualprod{\phi}{f}$ is Gaussian.
\end{definition}

This is an exceedingly broad definition, which is more useful as an organizing framework connecting different concepts than as a technical tool in its own right.
At first glance, it is not clear what, if anything, this notion has to do with the Gaussian processes we have considered previously.
To better understand this, an illustrative example is in order.

Let $f \~[GP](\mu,k)$ be a Gaussian process defined on $[0,1]$ whose sample paths are almost surely continuous, and note by compactness that they are automatically bounded.
Our Gaussian process can therefore by assumption be viewed as a random variable $f : \Omega \-> C^0([0,1];\R)$. 
We endow the latter space with the supremum norm, making it into a Banach space.
If we take another function $\phi \in C^\infty([0,1],\R)$, called the \emph{test function}, we can define the pairing
\[
\dualprod{\phi}{f} = \int_0^1 \phi(x)f(x) \d x
\]
which by boundedness is almost surely finite.
Now, note that since sums of Gaussians are Gaussian, Riemann sums of Gaussian processes are Gaussian.
Since limits of Gaussians are Gaussian, the quantity $\dualprod{\phi}{f}$ will be a \emph{Gaussian} scalar.
Therefore, a Gaussian in the sense of duality can loosely be thought of as a Gaussian process whose integral against arbitrary test functions is always Gaussian---an adaptation of the dot product notion encountered previously to the infinite-dimensional setting.

Of course, the above only describes how one can intuitively think about Gaussians in the sense of duality.
For a general Gaussians, there is no defined notion of an \emph{integral}---only of a dual pairing.
Such a Gaussian also need not be a random real-valued function: it's possible to consider random distributions and other objects generalizing the usual notion of a function.
It is therefore clear this view is very general.

This generality comes with a price: the resulting random vectors become more abstract, and it is much more difficult to understand whether or not they actually exist or say anything useful about them.
This difficulty is handled by specializing to less-general settings: for example, \textcite{bogachev98} studies the setting where $V$ is a locally convex topological vector space and $V^*$ is its topological dual, and \textcite{hairer09} studies cases where $V$ is a Banach or Hilbert space.
In those cases, a number of results are available.

Provided we are considering a Gaussian $f$ which does exist, what objects play the role of a mean and covariance, and uniquely characterize $f$?
Since the canonical pairing $\dualprod{\.}{\.}$ is linear and non-degenerate, we know that $f = g$ holds if and only if $\dualprod{\phi}{f} = \dualprod{\phi}{g}$ for all $\phi\in W$, with both equalities used in the same sense.
It is therefore clear that the \emph{mean} of a Gaussian process is simply a vector $\mu\in V$, since such a vector uniquely determines all expectations $\E\dualprod{\phi}{f}$.
The covariance is only slightly more subtle.

\begin{definition}[Covariance form]
We say that a symmetric positive semi-definite bilinear form $k : W \x W \-> \R$ is a \emph{covariance form}.
\end{definition}

As before, we can construct such a bilinear form from a given Gaussian process.

\begin{definition}[Covariance form of a Gaussian process]
The \emph{covariance form} of a Gaussian in the sense of duality is defined by 
\[
k(\phi,\psi) = \Cov(\dualprod{\phi}{f},\dualprod{\psi}{f})
.  
\]
\end{definition}


It is clear that two Gaussian processes $f$ and $g$ are equal in distribution if and only if they have the same mean and covariance form.
This can be seen by noting these requirements force $\dualprod{\phi}{f} = \dualprod{\phi}{g}$ to hold for all $\phi\in W$.

We now ask: what relationship does the covariance form have with the covariance kernel defined previously?
Consider again our Gaussian process $f$ defined on the space of continuous functions. 
For any pair of test functions $\phi,\psi \in C^\infty([0,1];\R)$, the symmetric positive semi-definite bilinear form
\[
(\phi,\psi) \|> \int_X\int_X \phi(x)k(x,x')\psi(x') \d x \d x'
\]
is the covariance form of $f$.

So far, this perspective mirrors the preceding ones, albeit with a more abstract presentation.
We have only introduced definitions.
These definitions, however, suffice to recover a notion of affine maps.

\begin{proposition}[Affine maps between Gaussian processes]
Let $f \~[GP](\mu, k)$. For $\c{A} : V \-> V'$ and $b\in V'$ we have 
\[
\c{A} f + b \~[GP](\c{A}f + b, k(\c{A}^*(\.),\c{A}^*(\.)))
\]
where $V'$ and $W'$ are a dual pair, and $\c{A}^* : W' \-> W$ is the adjoint operator defined by $\dualprod{\c{A}^*\phi}{v} = \dualprod{\phi}{\c{A}v}$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Immediate by definition.
\end{proof}

Suppose now that $V$ is a locally convex topological vector space, and $W = V^*$ its topological dual.
Since the covariance form is a map $k : V^* \x V^* \-> \R$, it gives rise to an operator $\c{K} : V^* \-> V^{**}$, called the \emphmarginnote{covariance operator}, which in the case that $V$ is reflexive becomes an operator $\c{K} : V^* \-> V$.
For our running example, this operator is given by 
\[
\phi \|> \int_X \phi(x)k(x,\.) \d x
.
\]
One can easily see that the transformation rule for covariance operators under affine maps is given by
\[
\c{K} \|> \c{A} \c{K}\c{A}^*
.    
\]
If it is often unclear whether or not a Gaussian process with a given covariance form exists, it is generally even less clear whether or not a Gaussian process with a given covariance operator exists.
Nonetheless, this notion is important, because in certain cases these operators can be studied using spectral theory.
We now move to the final concept we consider at this level of generality: that of a \emph{standard Gaussian}.

\begin{definition}[Gaussian white noise]
Let $W$ be a Hilbert space.
We say that $\c{W} : \Omega \-> V$ is a Gaussian white noise process if its covariance form is given by the inner product.
\end{definition}

In cases where $\c{K}$ admits a sufficiently rich spectral theory, this can potentially provide a suitable notion of an \emph{operator square root} which relates Gaussian white noise to other Gaussian processes.


With these definitions in hand, we have recovered the two technical notions lost when transitioning from multivariate Gaussians to Gaussian processes in the sense of random functions.
The introduced machinery gives a way of constructing Gaussian processes that is does not rely on defining a kernel: (a) construct a Gaussian white noise process, and (b) define the Gaussian process of interest as an affine map of white noise.

We employ a variation of this strategy in \Cref{ch:noneuclidean} to construct Gaussian processes on Riemannian manifolds, where defining a kernel directly leads to difficulties.
Loosely speaking, we do so by taking $V$ to be a space of distributions, and $\c{A}$ to be the inverse of a differential operator.
This is chosen to ensure that $\c{A}$ smooths its inputs, so that its output is regular enough to be understood as a random function.

This line of thought leads one to the theory of stochastic partial differential equations driven by Gaussian white noise.
The main point swept here under the rug is that there is a convenient way to sidestep much of the analysis needed to carry out the above calculations, using the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.
Roughly, this amounts to working with certain Lebesgue and Sobolev spaces, rather than distributions, which nonetheless sufficiently constrain behavior to uniquely determine the kernel of interest.

We also use the theory of Gaussians in the sense of duality for a second purpose: to construct a \emph{coordinate-free} notion of Gaussianity as a suitable building block for constructing Gaussian vector fields on Riemannian manifolds.
The issue here is that the Gaussian process \emph{cannot} be understood as a real-valued random function due to topological obstructions---it is instead a \emph{random section}, which we define in \Cref{ch:noneuclidean}.
Finite-dimensional Gaussians in the sense of duality end up being the right tool for this setting.

For this, we prove a general existence theorem on Gaussians in the sense of duality in finite-dimensional settings.
Aside from giving an intrinsic reinterpretation of the multivariate Gaussians described previously, this ensures our technical tool is suited for its purpose in the coordinate-free setting.

\begin{proposition}
Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional real topological vector space, and let $W = V^*$ be its topological dual.
Then for any vector $\mu \in V$ and covariance form $k : V^* \x V^* \-> \R$, there exists a unique-in-distribution random vector $y \~[N](\mu, k)$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
To prove this, choose a basis $e_i$ on $V$, and let $e^i$ be the dual basis. 
Let $V \-> \R^d$ be the continuous linear isomorphism induced by the basis, and define $y = \c{E}^{-1} \v{y}$ with $\v{y}\~[N](\v\mu,\m{K})$ defined by 
\[
\v\mu &= \begin{bmatrix}
\dualprod[0]{e^1}{\mu}
\\
\vdots
\\
\dualprod[0]{e^d}{\mu}
\end{bmatrix}
&
\m{K} &= \begin{bmatrix}
k(e^1, e^1) & \hdots & k(e^1, e^d)
\\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots
\\
k(e^d, e^1) & \hdots & k(e^d, e^d)
\end{bmatrix}  
.  
\]
It is clear by direct calculation using Gaussians on $\R^d$ that the resulting vector is Gaussian with the right mean and covariance form.
The claim follows by noting that assumed non-degeneracy of the dual pairing forces the distribution of every Gaussian in the sense of duality to be uniquely determined by its mean and covariance form.
\end{proof}

Here, we see the key difference between the coordinate-free view and the matrix-vector view considered previously: the Gaussian random vector can be viewed as a real-valued multivariate Gaussian in any basis, but itself is defined on $V$ independent of this choice.
The value of considering this distinction in the first place will become clear in \Cref{ch:noneuclidean}.
Here, finite-dimensionality suffices to ensure existence: the story in infinite-dimensional settings is completely different and requires case-by-case analysis.

To conclude, we reflect on the introduced ideas. 
We began by studying Gaussian random variables and random vectors, before generalizing these to Gaussian random functions, which offered a concrete framework where certain aspects of Gaussianity were seemingly lost.
Adopting a function-analytic view sufficed to restore these aspects, at cost of increased abstraction.
This view also provides a coordinate-free way to reinterpret the preceding multivariate constructions.

While much of the technical power of this framework is extraneous for our purposes, studying it nonetheless helps provide a unified conceptual framework from which to interpret our developments.
By considering these notions, it becomes much clearer how one should understand the constructions encountered later, which might otherwise appear as if they arise out of thin air.
This completes our study of Gaussianity for its own sake, independent of Bayesian learning and other machine-learning-related considerations.

\section{Discussion}

The preceding sections paint a rich and detailed picture of what a mathematical theory of decision-making under uncertainty looks like.
We now recap the steps taken so far, and reflect on them, before proceeding to describe contributions to be presented.

We began with the concept of probability, built and defined using the language of measure theory. 
We used this language to formalize the concept of learning using the notion of conditional probability, thereby obtaining the theory of \emph{Bayesian learning}.
By working in an abstract measure-theoretic setting, we obtained a formalism suitable for learning about very general unknown quantities of interest.

We then took a step back, examining how to formalize the notion of an agent selecting actions in an unknown environment on basis of interactions, obtaining the key concept of a \emph{Markov decision process}.
We then immediately restricted to the simpler setting of \emph{multi-armed bandits}.
We saw that model-based algorithms built atop Bayesian learning yielded decision systems that perform provably well.
Using these notions, we described how to efficiently solve global optimization problems using \emph{Bayesian optimization}.

To transform the preceding ideas into a workable class of methods, we proceeded to study \emph{Gaussian process} models in depth.
We developed them in sequence, starting from the simplest settings, and ending with the highest generality.
These preliminary developments provide us with the key tools in order to use Gaussian processes for the purpose of interest: namely, to build Bayesian models, and high-performance decision systems atop those models.

It is worth pausing to reflect on the relative merits of the choices made thus far.
In choosing to work with Bayesian learning, we opted to represent uncertainty using probability---a powerful but computationally limiting choice.
This choice was counterbalanced by working with simple models in bandit-like settings, and is most effective when the decisions of interest must be made in a data-efficient manner that only algorithms with near-asymptotically-optimal regret can achieve.

Not all settings fit these criteria well.
In many reinforcement learning problems of interest in robotics, the complexity of the dynamics---which, for multi-armed bandits, are totally absent from the problem---is a key difficulty.
Gaussian processes are largely not expressive enough to represent multi-object collision dynamics and related phenomena.
We have also not addressed partial observations---another key difficulty in that setting.

On the other hand, no other currently known theoretical framework comes close to understanding decision to the degree of command we have obtained.
In the absence of a probabilistic framework, it is highly non-trivial how to assess, represent, and propagate uncertainty in a manner that resolves explore-exploit tradeoffs to achieve optimal regret in non-trivial settings.
Thus, in settings where probabilistic methods can be used, they absolutely should be.

As a step towards building increasingly sophisticated decision systems, it seems fruitful to expand probabilistic approaches built via Bayesian learning to more general settings.
Improved understanding of these phenomena may yield lessons of broad interest to understanding of decision.
Contributions presented here include development of \emph{pathwise conditioning} methods for making Gaussian process models easier to work with, and a variety of \emph{non-Euclidean Gaussian processes}, both described next.


\chapter{Pathwise Conditioning}
\label{ch:pathwise}

\lettrine{G}{aussian processes} admit analytic conditional distributions, making them a key model class for Bayesian learning.
In reviewing these results, we illustrate a classical point of view used in machine learning, which mirrors the general measure-theoretic setup common to all Bayesian models, and has strongly influenced how people think about Gaussian processes.

In the early 1970s, an alternative view emerged in the geostatistics community.
Miraculously, in the Gaussian case it is also possible to develop conditioning in a manner not purely based on \emph{distributions}, but on \emph{random variables} directly.
This view turns out to lift from the multivariate to the Gaussian process setting, yielding \emph{pathwise} representations of posterior Gaussian processes, which have been overlooked in machine learning until now.

The pathwise perspective turns out to be a powerful point of view with wide-ranging consequences.
We will show how to use it to resolve a long-standing difficulty in Bayesian optimization: constructing a posterior approximation whose computational cost is linear both at training time and at test time, with excellent approximation properties and error control.

One of the key ingredients used within the construction will be basis function expansions of \emph{prior} Gaussian processes.
We will thus examine a number of methods for constructing such expansions for different classes of priors.
We will also reinterpret sparse approximations in a function-based manner simpler than the typical viewpoint.
We conclude by benchmarking Bayesian optimization using pathwise sampling.
We proceed to these developments.

\section{Conditioning multivariate Gaussians}

We now describe conditioning of multivariate Gaussians.
Recall that using Bayes' Rule, a prior and likelihood combine into a joint distribution, which factorizes into the marginal distribution of the data and the posterior.
The posterior is the conditional distribution of the parameters given the data, which is unique almost everywhere with respect to the marginal distribution.
We now study how to represent this distribution for the case of interest.

\subsection{Distributional conditioning}

The most obvious way to represent a Gaussian conditional distribution is to simply calculate it as a closed-form analytic expression.
This is given below.

\begin{proposition}[Multivariate Gaussian conditionals]
\label{prop:mvn-cond}
Let
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\v\theta
\\
\v{y}
\end{bmatrix} 
\~[N]\del{
\begin{bmatrix}
\v\mu_{\v\theta}
\\
\v\mu_{\v{y}}
\end{bmatrix}
,
\begin{bmatrix}
\m\Sigma_{\v\theta\v\theta} & \m\Sigma_{\v\theta\v{y}}
\\
\m\Sigma_{\v{y}\v\theta} & \m\Sigma_{\v{y}\v{y}}
\end{bmatrix} 
}
\]
be non-singular.
Then we have that
\[
(\v\theta\given\v{y})(\.,\v\gamma) \~[N]\del{\v\mu_{\v\theta} + \m\Sigma_{\v\theta\v{y}}\m\Sigma_{\v{y}\v{y}}^{-1}(\v\gamma-\v\mu_{\v{y}}), \m\Sigma_{\v\theta\v\theta} - \m\Sigma_{\v\theta\v{y}}\m\Sigma_{\v{y}\v{y}}^{-1}\m\Sigma_{\v{y}\v\theta}}
.
\]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
By non-singularity, $(\v\theta,\v{y})$ admits a Lebesgue density, and the claim follows by direct calculation via applying Bayes' Rule for densities.
\end{proof}

\begin{figure}
\begin{subfigure}{0.49\textwidth}

\end{subfigure}
\caption{Illustration of distributional conditioning of a bivariate Gaussian. Here, we form the joint distribution, calculate the conditional distribution, and then draw samples from it. Note that all steps except the very last one are \emph{distributional} in nature and do not involve the use of random variables, which only appear at the very end of the process.}
\label{fig:mvn-dist-cond}
\end{figure}

The non-singularity requirement is more-or-less necessary: otherwise, the marginal distribution of $\v{y}$ may admit too many null sets, rendering the desired conditional distribution non-unique, except in regions where one can apply a linear map to recover a suitable Lebesgue density and apply the above argument on the obtained subspace.

If one wants to work with this expression numerically, then it's possible to calculate the desired conditional mean and covariance. 
In particular, one can generate conditional sample via the expression
\[
(\v\theta\given\v{y})(\omega,\v\gamma) &= \m{L}_{\v\theta\given\v{y}}\v{z}(\omega) + \v\mu_{\v\theta\given\v{y}}
&
\v{z} &\~[N](\v{0},\m{I})
\]
where $\v\mu_{\v\theta\given\v{y}}$ is the conditional mean, and $\m{L}_{\v\theta\given\v{y}}$ is a Cholesky factor of the conditional covariance.
This enables one to calculate any quantity of interest depending on the conditional distribution numerically via the Monte Carlo method.
The computational costs will be cubic in the dimension of both $\v\theta$ and $\v{y}$, owing to the need to compute $\m{L}_{\v\theta\given\v{y}}$ and invert $\m\Sigma_{\v{y}\v{y}}$, respectively.


\subsection{Pathwise conditioning}

The preceding considerations gave closed-form analytic expressions for Gaussian conditionals in terms of matrix-vector expressions that can be computed numerically.
From this, one might be tempted to conclude that there is nothing more to say conditioning multivariate Gaussians---this, however, would miss an alternative view: Gaussian conditionals, which in general are a purely \emph{distributional} notion, can also be described in a \emph{pathwise} manner using \emph{random variables}.

\begin{restatable}[Matheron's update rule]{theorem}{thmmvnpw}
\label{thm:mvn-pw}
For $\v\theta,\v{y}$ defined in \Cref{prop:mvn-cond}, we have that
\[
(\v\theta\given\v{y})(\omega,\v\gamma) = \v\theta(\omega) + \m\Sigma_{\v\theta\v{y}}\m\Sigma_{\v{y}\v{y}}^{-1}(\v\gamma - \v{y}(\omega))
.    
\]
\end{restatable}

\begin{proof}
By direct calculation,
\[
\E(\v\theta + \m\Sigma_{\v\theta\v{y}}\m\Sigma_{\v{y}\v{y}}^{-1}(\v\gamma - \v{y})) = \v\mu_{\v\theta} + \m\Sigma_{\v\theta\v{y}}\m\Sigma_{\v{y}\v{y}}^{-1}(\v\gamma - \v\mu_{\v{y}}) = \E(\v\theta\given\v{y}=\v\gamma)
\]
and 
\[
\Cov(\v\theta + \m\Sigma_{\v\theta\v{y}}\m\Sigma_{\v{y}\v{y}}^{-1}(\v\gamma - \v{y})) &= \m\Sigma_{\v\theta\v\theta} + \m\Sigma_{\v\theta\v{y}}\m\Sigma_{\v{y}\v{y}}^{-1}  \m\Sigma_{\v{y}\v\theta} - 2\m\Sigma_{\v\theta\v{y}}\m\Sigma_{\v{y}\v{y}}^{-1} \m\Sigma_{\v{y}\v\theta}
\\
&= \m\Sigma_{\v\theta\v\theta} - \m\Sigma_{\v\theta\v{y}}\m\Sigma_{\v{y}\v{y}}^{-1}  \m\Sigma_{\v{y}\v\theta} = \Cov(\v\theta\given\v{y}=\v\gamma)
\]
where we have cancelled a factor of $\m\Sigma_{\v{y}\v{y}}\m\Sigma_{\v{y}\v{y}}^{-1}$ in the middle term.
\end{proof}

This affirms the claim, but gives few hints on where this expression originates or how to obtain it from first principles.
To better understand this, we now prove \Cref{thm:mvn-pw} in a different way.
To do so, we first prove a general result about conditioning.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:cond-repr}
Consider three random vectors $\v{a} : \Omega \-> \R^m$, $\v{b} : \Omega \-> \R^n$, and $\v{c} : \Omega \-> \R^m$ such that 
\[
\v{a} = f(\v{b}) + \v{c}    
\]
where $f : \R^n \-> \R^m$ is a measurable function, and where the random variables $\v{b}$ and $\v{c}$ are independent. 
Then we have 
\[
(\v{a} \given \v{b} = \v\beta) = f(\v\beta) + \v{c}    
.
\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This follows by direct calculation by writing
\[
\int_{A_{\v{b}}} \pi_{\v{a}\given\v{b}}(A_{\v{a}}\given\v\beta) \d\pi_{\v{b}}(\v\beta) &= \P(\v{a} \in A_{\v{a}}, \v{b} \in A_{\v{b}}) 
\\
&= \P(f(\v{b}) + \v{c} \in A_{\v{a}}, \v{b} \in A_{\v{b}})
\\
&= \int_{\R^m\x\R^n} \1_{f(\v\beta) + \v\varsigma \in A_{\v{b}}, \v\beta\in A_{\v{b}}} \d(\pi_{\v{c}}\ox\pi_{\v{b}})(\v\varsigma,\v\beta)
\\
&= \int_{A_{\v{b}}} \int_{\R^m} \1_{f(\v\beta) + \v\varsigma \in A_{\v{b}}} \d\pi_{\v{c}}(\v\varsigma) \d\pi_{\v{b}}(\v\beta)
\\
&= \int_{A_{\v{b}}} \P(f(\v\beta) + \v{c} \in A_a) \d\pi_{\v{b}}(\v\beta)
\]
where we have used independence to represent the probability as an integral over a product measure, followed by Tonelli's Theorem.
By the Disintegration Theorem, $\pi_{\v{a}\given\v{b}}$ is $\pi_{\v{b}}\ae[-]$ unique, implying that the conditional distributions of interest are equal, and the claim follows.
\end{proof}

The key idea behind our argument will be to choose the \emph{conditional expectation} for our function $f$, or more precisely, the map $\v{y} \|> \E(\v\theta\given\v{y})$.
We now recall this notion and some of its key properties.

Conditional expectation is defined as the orthogonal projection from the Lebesgue space $L^2(\Omega,\c{F},\P;\R^n)$ onto the subspace $L^2(\Omega,\sigma(\v{y}),\P;\R^n)$ where $\sigma(\v{y})$ is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing all preimages $\v{y}^{-1}(A_{\v{y}})$ where $A_{\v{y}}\in\c{B}(\R^n)$. 
Recall that the preimage is a map $\v{y}^{-1} : \c{B}(\R^n) \-> \c{F}$ between $\sigma$-algebras.
This definition is reasonably intuitive: we can think of this as projecting onto the subspace induced by all collections of random numbers in $\Omega$ which play a role in determining what $\v{y}$ does.

Recall that $L^2(\Omega,\c{F},\P;\R^n)$ is the Hilbert space of equivalence classes of random variables with inner product given by $\innerprod{\v{a}}{\v{b}} = \E(\v{a}\cdot\v{b})$.
Using this, it follows from the Projection Theorem for Hilbert spaces that the terms\footnote{TODO: check.} $\E(\v\theta\given\v{y})$ and $(\v\theta - \E(\v\theta\given\v{y}))$ are uncorrelated---and, in the Gaussian case, that they are independent.
This gives us the candidate random variables to use for $\v{b}$ and $\v{c}$, if we choose conditional expectation for $f$.

Finally, recall that for multivariate Gaussians, we have $\E(\v\theta\given\v{y}) = \m\Sigma_{\v\theta\v{y}}\m\Sigma_{\v{y}\v{y}}^{-1}\v{y}$, where we note in our setting that the inverse always exists by non-singularity of $\v{y}$.
With these preparations, we are ready to revisit \Cref{thm:mvn-pw}.

\v\theta = \E(\v\theta\given\v{y}) + (\v\theta - \E(\v\theta\given\v{y}))
\]
and note that since $\E(\v\theta\given\v{y})$ and $(\v\theta - \E(\v\theta\given\v{y}))$ are uncorrelated and jointly Gaussian, they are independent.
Applying \Cref{lem:cond-repr} yields
\[
(\v\theta\given\v{y}=\v\gamma) &= \m\Sigma_{\v\theta\v{y}}\m\Sigma^{-1}_{\v{y}\v{y}} \v\gamma + (\v\theta - \m\Sigma_{\v\theta\v{y}}\m\Sigma^{-1}_{\v{y}\v{y}} \v{y})
\\
&= \v\theta + \m\Sigma_{\v\theta\v{y}}\m\Sigma^{-1}_{\v{y}\v{y}}(\v\gamma - \v{y})
\]
where we have substituted $\E(\v\theta\given\v{y}) = \m\Sigma_{\v\theta\v{y}}\m\Sigma^{-1}_{\v{y}\v{y}} \v{y}$. 
The claim follows.
\end{proof}

From \Cref{thm:mvn-pw}, we obtain a second way of representing multivariate Gaussian conditionals.
This entails two steps: (i) sample $\v\theta,\v{y}$ jointly, and (ii) transform $\v\theta,\v{y}$ into $\v\theta\given\v{y}=\v\gamma$ by employing the given expression.
This procedure is illustrated in \Cref{fig:mvn-pw-cond}.

Remarkably, this result is missing from every machine learning textbook on Gaussian processes that I am aware of, and appears almost entirely unknown within the field.
It's possible this is because the expression's computational costs are cubic in the combined dimension, which is more expensive than the previous costs.
While this holds for general Gaussians, we show it can be avoided for many cases of practical interest in the sequel.

On the other hand, \Cref{thm:mvn-pw} is certainly known in other communities.
In a tribute to Georges Matheron, who pioneered the expression's use in geostatistics, \textcite{chiles05} say that:

\begin{quotation}
[Matheron's update rule] is nowhere to be found in Matheron's entire published works, as he merely regarded it as an immediate consequence of the orthogonality of the [conditional expectation] and the [residual process].
\end{quotation}

More recently, \textcite{doucet10} describes the algorithm in a technical report which begins with the remark: 

\begin{quotation}
This note contains no original material and will never be submitted anywhere for publication. However, it might be of interest to people working with [Gaussian processes] so I am making it publicly available.
\end{quotation}

The present state of affairs therefore seems to be that a small set of technical experts are aware of \Cref{thm:mvn-pw} but believe it to be too trivial to write about, while practitioners working in areas such as Bayesian optimization do not know that it exists.
While for multivariate Gaussians the result certainly is trivial, we will subsequently show that using it in the right manner yields significant progress towards resolving certain long-standing issues in decision-making settings.
To do so, we now consider Gaussian processes.

\section{Conditioning Gaussian processes}

We now study conditioning in Gaussian processes.
Specifically, we will develop and showcase the two points of view introduced above---distributional and pathwise---in the Gaussian process setting.
We begin with the former.

\subsection{Distributional conditioning}

The standard way of representing Gaussian process conditionals is to use the finiteness of the data to pick a sufficiently large grid of points, and work with finite-dimensional marginals.
Conditioning the Gaussian process then reduces to conditioning multivariate Gaussians.
We now describe this, setting the prior mean to zero to ease notation.

\begin{proposition}[Posterior Gaussian process]
\label{prop:gp-cond}
The Bayesian model
\[
\v{y} \given f &\~[N](\v{f}, \m\Sigma)
&
f &\~[GP](0,k)
\]
where $\v{f} = (f(x_1),..,f(x_n))$ admits a Gaussian process as its posterior. 
Denoting $f\given y_1 = \gamma_1,..,y_n = \gamma_n$ by $f\given \v{y}$ for brevity, this process satisfies
\[
f\given\v{y}\~[N](\m{K}_{(\.)x} \m{K}_{xx}^{-1}\v\gamma, \m{K}_{(\.,\.)} - \m{K}_{(\.)x} (\m{K}_{xx} + \m\Sigma)^{-1} \m{K}_{x(\.)})
.
\]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Apply \Cref{prop:mvn-cond} to a set of finite-dimensional marginals.
\end{proof}

\caption{Illustration of distributional conditioning of a Gaussian process. Here, we calculate the conditional distribution at a finite set of locations, and then draw samples from a multivariate Gaussian. This view of conditioning is called \emph{distributional}, since random variables appear only at the end of the process.}
\label{fig:gp-dist-cond}
\end{figure}

This result gives us a way of carrying out Bayesian learning using Gaussian processes, given a finite set of data.
Note the \emph{bottom-up} nature of this perspective: we describe the posterior Gaussian process---which is an actual \emph{process} defined everywhere---using its posterior finite-dimensional marginals.

We now consider computational costs of the above formula.
Calculating posterior moments clearly entails cubic costs with respect to the data size $n$, owing the need to invert $n\x n$ matrices.
Now, suppose we are are interested in computing quantities involving the posterior distribution.
Consider for instance computing the Thompson sampling acquisition function considered in \Cref{sec:bayesian-optimization}, which we recall is 
\[
x_{t+1}(\omega) &= \argmax_{x\in X} \phi_t(\omega,x)
&
\phi_t&\~ f \given \v{y}
.
\]
Given the minimization involved in this objective, there is no chance in finding an analytic expression for $x_{t+1}$, and we must resort to numerical methods.
Just about any numerical procedure one can imagine---for instance, gradient descent---will involve drawing random samples from $f\given\v{y}$ at different locations, and performing the necessary algorithmic operations on them.
Summarizing, the computational costs of this expression are as follows.

\1 Data: $\c{O}(n^3)$ where $n$ is the size of the training set.
\2 Predictions: $\c{O}(n_*^3)$ where $n_*$ is the number of locations the posterior needs to be jointly evaluated at.
\0

This becomes more difficult if one considers that the evaluation locations may not be known in advance, and might be determined using previous points.
Due to the need to factorize matrices at every intermediate computation step, roundoff errors will accumulate as computations proceed.
Thus, even if we are willing to pay cubic costs, we must then face the secondary issue of numerical instability.
The situation if one needs to differentiate through objectives such as $\phi_t$ is even worse.

Without additional considerations, these costs are disastrous, and illustrate the difficulties in making methods such as Bayesian optimization perform effectively in practice.
Fortunately, a wide variety of techniques to deal with them are available: in particular, \emph{inducing point} methods provide a broad set of approximations for reducing the $\c{O}(n^3)$ costs.
We will complement these ideas by introducing techniques to tackle the $\c{O}(n_*^3)$ costs in the sequel.
For this, we proceed to develop a pathwise view of conditioning.

\subsection{Pathwise conditioning}

Given the pathwise view of conditioning multivariate Gaussians given by Matheron's Update Rule, one can ask: is there an analogous statement for Gaussian processes?
Does the purely notion of a Gaussian conditional distribution have an analogous description in terms of random functions?
We answer this affirmatively below.

\begin{corollary}[Posterior Gaussian process (pathwise)]
\label{cor:gp-pw}
For $\v{y}\given f$, $f$, and $\v{f}$ defined in \Cref{prop:gp-cond}, we have
\[
(f \given\v{y})(\omega,\v\gamma) \overset{\d}{=} f(\omega,\.) + \m{K}_{(\.)\v{x}} (\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}} + \m\Sigma)^{-1}(\v\gamma - \v{f}(\omega) - \v\eps(\omega))
\]
where $\v\eps \~[N](\v{0},\m\Sigma)$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Apply \Cref{thm:mvn-pw} to a set of finite-dimensional marginals.
\end{proof}

\begin{figure}
\begin{subfigure}{0.49\textwidth}
\input{figures/tex/gp-pw-prior.tex}
\caption{Sample from prior}
\end{subfigure}
\begin{subfigure}{0.49\textwidth}
\input{figures/tex/gp-pw-cond.tex}
\caption{Transform into conditional}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Illustration of pathwise conditioning of a Gaussian process. Here, we first sample a random function from the prior, along with random noise variables at each of the data locations, then transform these into a sample from the posterior distribution.
This view of conditioning is termed \emph{pathwise}, since it is defined directly at the level of random functions.}
\label{fig:gp-pw-cond}
\end{figure}

Note that in this expression, the prior is evaluated jointly at all locations---the random variables $f(\omega,\.)$ and $\v{f}(\omega)$ are \emph{dependent}.
Similarly, equality can clearly only hold in distribution because the random variable $(f\given\v{y})(\.,\v\gamma)$ is only defined in distribution to begin with.

\Cref{cor:gp-pw} gives an alternative way of representing posterior Gaussian processes: (i) sample the prior and all auxillary random variables, and (ii) transform the sampled function to form the posterior as a random function.
This is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:gp-pw-cond}.

This strategy can be carried out if we know the locations we wish to evaluate the posterior at.
In this case, we sample the prior at the data and evaluation locations jointly, and transform the resulting samples into posterior samples.
Examining the computational costs, we see these are $\c{O}(n^3)$ with respect to data size, and $\c{O}(n_*^3)$ with respect to the number of evaluation locations.
At this stage, then, we have seemingly only gained numerical stability.

\Cref{cor:gp-pw}, however, is not merely a computational result: it gives us a \emph{different way of thinking} about posterior Gaussian processes. 
In particular, we can use the point of view it offers to construct posterior approximations.
Observe that the cubic costs $\c{O}(n_*^3)$ occur entirely due to the need to jointly sample the prior at all evaluation locations.
Suppose, then, that we can approximately express the prior as 
\[
f(\omega,\.) &\approx \tilde{f}(\omega,\.) = \sum_{i=1}^\ell w_i(\omega)\phi_i(\.)
&
w_j &\~[N](0,1)
.
\]
We can substitute this approximation into \Cref{cor:gp-pw} to obtain
\[
(f \given\v{y})(\omega,\v\gamma) \overset{\d}{\approx} \tilde{f}(\omega,\.) + \m{K}_{(\.)\v{x}} (\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}} + \m\Sigma)^{-1}(\v\gamma - \v{\tilde{f}}(\omega) - \v\eps(\omega))
\]
where $\tilde{f}_n = \tilde{f}(\.,x_n)$.
We illustrate this idea in Figure \ref{fig:pw-cond-gp-rff}.
Once the random weights $\v{w}$ are sampled, the posterior becomes a deterministic function, which can be evaluated at $\c{O}(n_*)$ costs.
Thus, under this approximations, our cubic costs with respect to the number of evaluation locations become \emph{linear}.
We show in the sequel that for appropriate choices of $\tilde{f}$, such approximations can achieve excellent error control, ensuring they perform effectively in practice.

\begin{figure*}
\input{figures/tex/gp-cond.tex}
\caption{Approximate pathwise conditioning, with bases on bottom row.}
\label{fig:pw-cond-gp-rff}
\end{figure*}

We now examine a different aspect of the pathwise representation of posterior Gaussian processes: the role of the data.
By re-expressing the matrix-vector product of the kernel matrix term $\m{K}_{(\.)\v{x}}$ as a sum, we obtain
\[
(f \given\v{y})(\omega,\v\gamma) \overset{\d}{=} f(\omega,\.) + \sum_{j=1}^n v_j(\omega) k(x_j,\.)
\]
where $\v{v} = (\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}} + \m\Sigma)^{-1}(\v\gamma - \v{\tilde{f}}(\omega) - \v\eps(\omega))$.
This \ref{cor:gp-pw} identifies the effect of the data in a posterior Gaussian process as the addition of \emph{canonical basis functions} $k(x_i,\.)$ to the prior.
We explore this interpretation further in the sequel.
From this viewpoint, our approximate posterior is
\[
(f \given\v{y})(\omega,\v\gamma) \overset{\d}{\approx} \sum_{i=1}^\ell w_i(\omega)\phi_i(\.) + \sum_{j=1}^n v_j(\omega) k(x_j,\.)
\]
which shows that our proposed approximation involves writing the posterior Gaussian process of interest as a sum of \emph{two} finite sets of basis functions---one for the prior, another for the data.
The basis coefficients $w_i$ and $v_j$ here are dependent random variables.
Summarizing, pathwise representations of posterior Gaussian processes provide a useful framework for constructing posterior approximations.

In Bayesian optimization, the preceding techniques offer a promising avenue to avoid the computational difficulties described previously.
If we again consider Thompson sampling, computing quantities such as
\[
x_{t+1}(\omega) &= \argmax_{x\in X} \phi_t(\omega,x)
&
\phi_t&\~ f \given \v{y}
\]
can be done using a simple Monte Carlo approach as follows.

\1 Sample the random weights $(\v{w}, \v{v})$ to form the approximate posterior.
\2 Maximize the approximate posterior using any numerical procedure.
\0

The key advantage of this approach is that once the random weights are sampled, the posterior---a random function---effectively becomes deterministic.
This allows us to not only evaluate it in linear time, but also to differentiate through posterior samples using automatic differentiation---here, enabling us to maximize them using gradient descent without computing gradient processes or employing special considerations of any kind.

In total, we obtain a substantially more accurate and efficient way to compute acquisition functions such as Thompson sampling.
To obtain a complete algorithm, all that remains is to find finite basis approximations to Gaussian process priors: this will require additional structure present in specific classes of kernels.
We proceed to explore a number of techniques for doing so.

\section{Sampling from prior Gaussian processes}

In the preceding section, we explored a class of approximate posterior Gaussian processes constructed by plugging a finite-basis-function-based approximate prior into the pathwise update.
Such approximate priors can be constructed in many ways, including by expressing the true prior within a basis of an appropriate space of functions, and truncating the resulting infinite sum.
Different choices of bases will result in different applicability, ease of use, and approximation error.
We now explore possible choices.


\subsection{Random feature methods}

For stationary kernels on Euclidean spaces, random feature methods can be used to construct approximate priors whose properties make them one of the most attractive choices possible.
We examine these now.

To construct a basis function expansion, our strategy will be to find a \emph{feature map} $\varphi : \c{X} \-> \c{H}_k$ that maps states into vectors in the \emph{reproducing kernel Hilbert space} induced by $k$.
This is defined as follows.

\begin{definition}[Reproducing kernel Hilbert space]
Let $X$ be a set, and let $\c{H} \subseteq \R^X$ be a Hilbert space of functions. 
We say that $\c{H}$ is a \emph{reproducing kernel Hilbert space} if, for any $x\in X$, we have $\f{ev}_x \in \c{H}^*$ where $\f{ev}_x : \c{H} \-> \R$ is called the \emph{evaluation map} and is defined by $\f{ev}_x f = f(x)$.
\end{definition}

Ostensibly, this definition has nothing to do with kernels, and it is unclear what a reproducing kernel Hilbert space \emph{induced by} $k$ actually means.
A consequence of the above definition is that given a reproducing kernel Hilbert space $\c{H}$, we can define the function $k_{\c{H}}(x,x') = \innerprod[1]{\Psi_{\c{H}}^{-1}\f{ev}_x}{\Psi^{-1}_{\c{H}}\f{ev}_{x'}}$, called the \emphmarginnote{reproducing kernel}, where $\Psi_{\c{H}} : \c{H} \-> \c{H}^*$ is the bijective linear isometry given by the Riesz Representation Theorem.
It is easy to see that $k_{\c{H}}$ is positive semi-definite.\footnote{TODO: check if it's PD or PSD.}
It turns out a converse statement also holds.

\begin{result}[Moore--Aronszajn Theorem]
Let $k : X \x X \-> \R$ be a symmetric positive semi-definite kernel.
Then there is a unique Hilbert space $\c{H}_k \subseteq \R^X$ for which $k$ is the reproducing kernel.
\end{result}

\begin{proof}
TODO: cite.
\end{proof}

This gives another point of view from which one can study and understand kernels.
We will need one final notion.
We say that a function $\varphi : X \-> \c{H}_k$ is a \emphmarginnote{feature map} if $k(x,x') = \innerprod{\phi(x)}{\phi(x')}$.
Now, we introduce the key idea for constructing our approximate Gaussian prior: suppose we have a \emph{finite-dimensional} approximation for such a feature map, namely a vector-valued function $\v\phi : X \-> \R^\ell$ such that $\v\phi(x)^T \v\phi(x') = \innerprod{\phi(x)}{\phi(x')}$.
Then
\[
\tilde{f}(\.) &= \sum_{i=1}^\ell w_i(\omega) \phi_i(\.)
&
w_i &\~[N](0,1)
\]
by direct calculation has covariance approximately equal to that of $f$.
Therefore, to construct an approximate prior, it suffices to find a finite-dimensional approximate feature map.

For stationary kernels, techniques for constructing approximate feature maps are well-studied, originally motivated by questions arising in kernel support vector machines.
We now introduce the \emph{random Fourier feature} method for constructing such maps, beginning with a description of the stationary setting.

\parmarginnote{Stationary kernel}
Let $X = \R^d$.
We say that a kernel $k(\v{x},\v{x}')$ is called \emph{stationary} if $k(\v{x},\v{x}') = k(\v{x} - \v{x})$ for a function $k : \R^d \-> \R$.
A stationary kernel, then, is a two-argument positive definite function which factorizes through a one-argument function depending only on the difference between two points.
Note that such a kernel is invariant under translation and can be characterized as such.
We will need a result known as \emph{Bochner's Theorem}.

\begin{result}[Bochner's Theorem]
For every stationary continuous positive definite kernel with $k(\v{x},\v{x}) = 1$ there is a symmetric probability measure $\rho$ on $\R^d$ which we call the \emph{spectral measure} of $k$.
Moreover, $k$ admits the representation
\[
k(\v{x} - \v{x}') = \int_{\R^d} e^{2\pi i \v\varpi^T (\v{x} - \v{x}')} \d\rho(\v\varpi)
.
\]
Conversely, every probability measure on $\R^d$ gives rise to such a kernel via its inverse Fourier transform.
\end{result}

\begin{proof}
TODO: cite.
\end{proof}

Here, \emph{symmetry} of $\rho$ refers to invariance under reflection about the origin.
This result is true more generally if $X$ is replaced by a locally compact Abelian group, for which the corresponding spectral measure will be supported on the Pontryagin dual group---we omit this level of generality because we will not need it.
We do briefly note, however, that this means that spectral measures of kernels on compact spaces are \emph{discrete}---this behavior will reappear under a different guise in \Cref{ch:noneuclidean}.\footnote{TODO: don't forget to actually mention this.}

\caption{Illustration of random Fourier feature methods for sampling from approximate priors. Here, we show a small subset of randomly sampled Fourier basis functions, along with approximate prior samples constructed using the random Fourier basis functions.}
\label{fig:gp-rff-prior}
\end{figure}

From here, it is clear that the feature map we seek can be constructed by Monte Carlo sampling the integral representation given by Bochner's Theorem.
To maintain order, we introduce a \emph{second} probability space $(\Xi,\c{G},\bb{Q})$ to distinguish the stochasticity associated with the random feature expansion from stochasticity associated with the Gaussian process.
Letting $k(\v{x},\v{x}) = \sigma^2$, write
\[
k(\v{x} - \v{x}') &= \sigma^2 \int_{\R^d} e^{2\pi i \v\varpi^T (\v{x} - \v{x}')} \d\rho(\v\varpi)
\\
&= \sigma^2 \int_{\R^d} e^{2\pi i \v\varpi^T \v{x}} \conj{e^{2\pi i \v\varpi^T \v{x}'}} \d\rho(\v\varpi)
\\
&\approx \frac{\sigma^2}{\ell} \sum_{j=1}^\ell e^{2\pi i \v\varpi_j(\xi)^T \v{x}} \conj{e^{2\pi i \v\varpi_j(\xi)^T \v{x}'}}
\\
&= \frac{\sigma^2}{\ell} \sum_{i=1}^\ell \begin{aligned}
\cos&(2\pi \v\varpi_i(\xi)^T \v{x})\cos(2\pi \v\varpi_i(\xi)^T \v{x}') 
\\
+&\sin(2\pi \v\varpi_i(\xi)^T \v{x})\sin(2\pi \v\varpi_i(\xi)^T \v{x}')
\end{aligned}
\\
&= \v\phi(\xi,\v{x})^T\v\phi(\xi,\v{x}')
\]
where
\[
\phi_i(\xi,\v{x}) = \begin{cases}
\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{\ell}} \cos(2\pi \v\varpi_i(\xi)^T \v{x}), & i \t{odd}
\\[2ex]
\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{\ell}} \sin(2\pi \v\varpi_{i-1}(\xi)^T \v{x}), & i \t{even}
\end{cases}
\]
which, for $\ell$ even, gives our approximate prior as
\[
\tilde{f}(\.) &= \sum_{i=1}^\ell w_i(\omega) \phi_i(\xi,\.)
&
w_i &\~[N](0,1)
&
\v\varpi_i &\~ \rho
.
\]

What is remarkable about random feature methods is that, owing to the Monte Carlo approximation, the decay rate of appropriately defined approximation error is \emph{dimension-free}.
This limits the effect of the curse of dimensionality to constant factors.
Better yet, random feature methods are well-understood owing to their widespread use in other areas, and error bounds are available \cite{sutherland15}.
For this reason, they are often the technique of choice for stationary Euclidean kernels.
We now consider other cases.

\subsection{Karhunen--Lo√®ve expansions}

Among all techniques for constructing approximate priors, different techniques will generally yield different amounts of error for the same number of basis functions.
One can then ask: is there an optimal choice?
Of course, the answer to this question will depend on what one actually means by the word \emph{optimal}.

If we take $X \subset \R^d$ to be closed and compact, and we use expected mean squared error---which we recall is equivalent to the $L^1(\Omega;L^2(X;\R))$ norm---as our notion of optimality, one can affirmatively answer the above question.
Recall that a continuous kernel $k : X \x X \-> \R$ induces a covariance operator
\[
\c{K} : L^2(X;\R) &\-> L^2(X;\R)
&
\c{K} : \phi &\|> \int_X \phi(x) k(x,\.) \d x
\]
where by writing $\norm{\c{K} \phi}_{L^1(X;\R)} \leq \vol(X) \norm{k}_{C^0(X\x X;\R)} \norm{\phi}_{L^2(X;\R)}$ using compactness and boundedness of $k$ we affirm correctness of the operator's domain and range.
By compactness, $\c{K}$ will admit a countable set of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.
It turns out, that, by the Karhunen--Lo√®ve Theorem, the Gaussian process itself can be written in terms of the same eigenvalues and eigenfunctions as well.

\begin{result}[Karhunen--Lo√®ve Theorem]
Let $X \subseteq \R^d$ be closed and compact, and let $f$ be a Gaussian process with continuous covariance function.
Then we have
\[
f(\omega,\.) &= \sum_{i=1}^\infty w_i(\omega) \phi_i(\.)
&
w_i &\~[N](0,1)
\]
where convergence holds almost surely, and $\phi_i$ are an orthogonal basis on $L^2(X;\R)$ given by rescaled eigenfunctions of the covariance operator.
Moreover, for every $\ell\in \N$, truncating this series yields an $L^1(\Omega;L^2(X;\R))$-optimal approximation among all $\ell$-term sums of $L^2(X;\R)$-orthogonal functions.
\end{result}

\begin{proof}
TODO: cite.
\end{proof}

More generally, an analogous result, albeit with a weaker form of convergence, also holds for general \emph{square-integrable} stochastic processes which may be non-Gaussian.
Since we will not consider such processes, we do not pursue this direction here.

For this kernel, the basis functions coincide with the eigenfunctions of the Dirichlet Laplacian.
We show the first four eigenfunctions, along with approximate prior samples using the first 87 terms in the expansion. This truncation was chosen because the remaining terms are zero in floating-point arithmetic, highlighting the approximation's efficiency.}
\label{fig:gp-kl-prior}
\end{figure}

For a general kernel, finding the eigenfunctions of the covariance operator may be difficult.
For certain classes of Gaussian processes constructed to satisfy appropriate boundary constraints, however, the eigenfunctions of the covariance operator will coincide with the eigenfunctions of a boundary-constrained Laplacian.
These can be obtained numerically, giving a suitable way for sampling from priors in the boundary-constrained setting.

Kernels induced by eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of appropriately-defined Laplace operators are also a common tool in non-Euclidean settings, and we explore them further in \Cref{ch:noneuclidean}.
For the moment, however, we consider a third class of approximations.

\subsection{Finite element methods}

We now introduce the third class of approximations we will consider: those constructed via \emph{finite element approximations} of solutions of stochastic partial differential equations.
Many Gaussian process priors, including the widely-used Mat√©rn class, can be expressed in such a manner.
Gaussian processes which satisfy stochastic partial differential equations are also of direct interest in non-Euclidean settings considered in \Cref{ch:noneuclidean}.

Let $X$ be a sufficiently well-behaved subset of a Euclidean space, or a Riemannian manifold.
Suppose our Gaussian process $f$ satisfies the equation 
\[
\c{L}f = \c{W} 
\]
where $\c{L} : H \-> L^2(X)$ is a bounded linear operator acting on a certain reproducing kernel Hilbert space which uniquely determines the Gaussian process, and $\c{W}$ is a white noise process over $L^2(X)$.
Slightly more precisely, this equation is meant in the sense of an almost sure equality
\[
f(\omega,\c{L}^* h) = \c{W}(\omega, h)
\]
between generalized Gaussian fields---a formal treatment is given in \Cref{ch:noneuclidean}.
Assume that the generalized Gaussian field $f : \Omega \x H \-> \R$ can be written as the integral of a Gaussian process $f : \Omega \x X \-> \R$ as
\[
f(\omega, h) = \int_X f(\omega, x) h(x) \d x
\]
which holds provided that $f$ is measurable.
This, in turn, depends on regularity properties of the kernel, but will hold in essentially all practical cases of interest, and in particular on closed compact domains $X$ follows from sample-continuity.
If we define the bilinear form 
\[
a(\phi,\psi) = \int_X \phi(x) (\c{L}^*\psi)(x) \d x    
\]
then our stochastic partial differential equation becomes
\[
a(f(\omega,\.), h) = \c{W}(\omega, h)
\]
which is an equation between a Gaussian process, bilinear form, and random linear functional.
Now, we introduce approximations: suppose that $f(\omega,x) \approx \tilde{f}(\omega,x) = \sum_{i=1}^\ell w_i(\omega) \phi_i(x)$ and that $h(x) \approx \sum_{j=1}^\ell v_j \psi_j(x)$.
Plugging this in and differentiating to remove the coefficients $v_j$ yields 
\[
\sum_{i=1}^\ell w_i(\omega) a(\phi_i,\psi_j) = \c{W}(\omega, \psi_j)
\]
which by defining $A_{ij} = a(\phi_i,\psi_j)$ and $b_j(\omega) = \c{W}(\omega, \psi_j)$ can be recognized as a random linear system, more compactly written
\[
\m{A} \v{w}(\omega) = \v{b}(\omega)
.
\]
If we let $\m{M} = \Cov(\v{b})$ with $\Cov(b_i,b_j) = \innerprod{\psi_i}{\psi_j}$---where we note that since $\c{W}$ is a white noise process, the matrix $\m{M}$ coincides with the finite-element mass matrix---we obtain the distribution for the basis coefficients. 
Our approximate prior can therefore be written
\[
\tilde{f}(\omega,x) &= \sum_{i=1}^\ell w_i(\omega) \phi_i(x)
&
\v{w} &\~[N](\v{0},\m{A}^{-1}\m{M}\m{A}^{-T})\
.
\]
What is particularly powerful about this technique is that it gives us a significant degree of freedom for what kinds of finite sets of basis functions we can choose for $\phi$ and $\psi$.
A fruitful choice, provided the operator $\c{L}$ is a differential operator of sufficiently low order that this makes sense, is to take them to be compactly supported piecewise linear functions, since this will cause the matrices $\m{A}$ and $\m{M}$ to be sparse.
This can enable one to use a much larger set of basis functions compared to alternative methods.

Since this bilinear form is of first order in both arguments, we employ a piecewise linear finite element basis consisting of compactly supported triangle-shaped functions, using it to represent both $f$ and $h$.
This results in matrices $\m{A}$ and $\m{M}$ which are symmetric tridiagonal.}

\end{figure}

The main difficulty with finite element methods is that they typically demand more from practitioners compared to alternatives.
In particular, one usually needs to understand the stochastic partial differential equations governing the Gaussian process of interest with a reasonable degree of detail to know how to choose basis functions well.
Additionally, sparse linear algebra in a parallel environment with automatic differentiation can be cumbersome.

This concludes our presentation of techniques for constructing approximate priors.
In general, the best choice for a particular application will depend on the detailed requirements of the situation.
We now proceed to study other aspects of the pathwise viewpoint.

\section{Approximating pathwise data-dependent terms}

In the preceding section, we discussed techniques for approximating the prior using a finite set of basis functions with random coefficients.
This enabled us to construct approximate pathwise representations of posterior Gaussian processes with $\c{O}(n_*)$ computational complexity, where we recall again that $n_*$ is the number of points where we wish to evaluate the posterior at.
We now consider the other computational costs in the formula: $\c{O}(n^3)$, where $n$ is the size of the training data.
These arise because computing
\[
(f \given\v{y})(\omega,\v\gamma) \overset{\d}{=} f(\omega,\.) + \m{K}_{(\.)\v{x}} (\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}} + \m\Sigma)^{-1}(\v\gamma - \v{f}(\omega) - \v\eps(\omega))
\]
requires us to invert an $n\x n$ matrix.
We now ask: from a pathwise perspective, what techniques are available for reducing these costs?

\subsection{Inducing points}

Consider a simple approach to reducing the above cubic costs: instead of conditioning the Gaussian process on the full set of values $(x_1,y_1),..,(x_n,y_n)$, find a different data set $(z_1,\mu_1),..,(z_m,\mu_m)$, for which $m \ll  n$ and yet the posterior is approximately the same.
To ensure this approximation is expressive enough, we can either (i) make $\v\mu$ random with a learnable mean and covariance, or (ii) introduce a learned noise covariance $\m\Lambda$, rather than reusing the one from the original model.
The latter gives
\[
(f \given\v{u})(\omega,\v\mu) = f(\omega,\.) + \m{K}_{(\.)\v{z}} (\m{K}_{\v{z}\v{z}} + \m\Lambda)^{-1}(\v\mu - \v{f}(\omega) - \v\epsilon(\omega))
\]
where $f\given\v{u}$ is the posterior under the modified likelihood employing the noise covariance $\m\Lambda$.
This approximation has a particularly simple interpretation: we can re-write it as
\[
(f \given\v{u})(\omega,\v\mu) = f(\omega,\.) + \sum_{j=1}^m v_j(\omega) k(z_j,\.)
\]
where $\v{v}(\omega) = (\m{K}_{\v{z}\v{z}} + \m\Lambda)^{-1}(\v\mu - \v{f}(\omega) - \v\epsilon(\omega))$.
Thus, we see that all we have done is replaced a large sum of data-dependent functions $k(x_j,\.)$ with $j=1,..,n$ induced by the kernel with a much smaller sum involving a sparsified set of functions $k(z_j,\.)$ with $j=1,..,m$ and $m \ll n$.

Given such an approximate posterior, how should we select the introduced hyperparameters $\v{z},\v\mu,\m\Lambda$ to ensure quality?
At minimum, we should attempt to guarantee consistency of the approximation, in the sense that if $m = n$ then one can choose $\v{z} = \v{x}$, $\v\mu = \v\gamma$, and $\m\Lambda = \m\Sigma$ to recover the desired posterior.
We therefore seek to minimize some notion of \emph{distance} on the space of probability measures.

The most natural choice one can consider is arguably the one that emerged from the analysis of Bayes' Rule presented in \Cref{ch:intro}: namely, the \emph{Kullback--Leibler divergence}.
Minimizing this amounts to replacing the measure space in the variational formulation of Bayes' Rule of \Cref{prop:variational-bayes} with the parameterized subspace of measures induced by the set of approximate posteriors with different parameter values, which we the \emph{variational family}.
This yields the optimization problem 
\[
\argmin_{\bb{q}_f\in\bb{Q}} D_{\f{KL}}(\bb{q}_f \from \pi_f) + \frac{1}{2}\operatorname*{\E}_{f\~\bb{q}_f} (\v\gamma - f(\v{x}))^T \m\Sigma^{-1} (\v\gamma - f(\v{x}))
\]
where $\bb{Q}$ is the set of all measures equal to the distribution of $f\given\v{u}$ for some choice of variational parameter values $\v{z},\v\mu,\m\Lambda$, and $\bb{q}_f$ is the distribution of $f\given\v{u}$ for a specific set of such values.
Note that we have dropped constant terms from the likelihood density because they do not affect the optima.
Our \emph{variational approximation} is obtained by solving this optimization problem, which it turns out is necessarily well-posed.

\begin{proposition}[Variational objective for inducing point approximations]
For all $\v{x},\v{y},\m\Sigma$, and all $\v{z},\v\mu,\m\Lambda$, the Kullback--Leibler divergence $D_{\f{KL}}(\bb{q}_f \from \pi_{f \given\v{y}})$ is finite and equal to the above objective up to an additive constant.
Moreover, the prior Kullback--Leibler divergence $D_{\f{KL}}(\bb{q}_f \from \pi_f) = D_{\f{KL}}(\bb{q}_{f(\v{z})} \from \pi_{f(\v{z})})$ reduces to the Kullback--Leibler divergence between the respective finite-dimensional marginal distributions at the inducing locations $\v{z}$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
We consider the two terms in the objective and the additive constant.
\1 Finiteness of the first term, along with the second claim, follows by the chain rule for Kullback--Leibler divergences, since $\bb{q}_f$ is by construction a conditional distribution of a Gaussian process with the same covariance kernel as $k$.
\2 Finiteness of the second term follows immediately, because it is the expectation of a quadratic with respect to a multivariate Gaussian.
\3 Finiteness of the additive constant also follows, because it is by definition the log-density of a multivariate Gaussian.
\0 
The claim follows. 
\end{proof}

We have therefore proven that the \emph{inducing point} approximation of \textcite{opper09}, when re-interpreted using the variational inference framework of \textcite{titsias09}, coincides with the pathwise variational approximation constructed here.
The same is true for other classes of inducing points, including the family where $\v{u}$ is randomized, as originally proposed by \textcite{titsias09}.

\caption{The type of approximation made using inducing points can be understood in a pathwise manner: the inducing approximation employs the seven displayed canonical basis functions, rather than the thirty-one used in the true posterior, which possess significantly more overlap.
The update term fades to zero as we move away from the data, highlighting the role of the prior in representing uncertainty.}
\label{fig:gp-inducing-basis}
\end{figure}

Better yet, the constructions above are straightforward, principled, and mathematically sound.
In particular, we do not rely on heuristic arguments involving \emph{evidence lower bounds} which effectively require us to \emph{posit} that optimizing certain quantities will result in improved posterior approximation.
Instead, by virtue of the Kullback--Leibler divergence generating a Hausdorff topology on the space of probability measures, this is proven.

This concludes our study of inducing point methods from the pathwise perspective, which are identified with sparsified pathwise approximations where instead of a sum of $n$ kernel terms, we have a smaller sum of $m \ll n$ kernel terms.
We now consider another class of approximations that one can consider using in practice.

\subsection{Approximate priors}
In the preceding sections, we presented a number of posterior approximations which were built by approximating individual terms within the pathwise formalism.
We considered approximations where the prior term is replaced with a finite basis function approximation, and where the data term is replaced with a sparser analog.
An obvious question one can ask is, instead of approximating the prior term, why not just change the model by using a finite basis function prior to begin with?

The answer to this question is that the resulting model becomes fundamentally finite-dimensional, and loses expressive capacity, resulting in reduced performance.
This can be seen precisely by comparing its pathwise update 
\[
\tilde{f}(\omega,\.) + \ubr{\v\phi(\.)^T\v\phi(\v{x})}_{\t{replaces}\,\m{K}_{(\.)\v{x}}} (\ubr{\v\phi(\v{x})^T\v\phi(\v{x})}_{\t{replaces}\,\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}} } + \m\Sigma)^{-1}(\v\gamma - \v{\tilde{f}}(\omega) - \v\eps(\omega))
\]
to the pathwise update
\[
f(\omega,\.) + \m{K}_{(\.)\v{x}} (\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}} + \m\Sigma)^{-1}(\v\gamma - \v{\tilde{f}}(\omega) - \v\eps(\omega))
\]
under the original, infinite-dimensional prior.
Observe that all that has changed is that the kernel matrices $\m{K}_{(\.)\v{x}}$ and $\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}$ have been replaced with the approximations $\v\phi(\.)^T\v\phi(\v{x})$ and $\v\phi(\v{x})^T\v\phi(\v{x})$.
Observe further that since $\tilde{f}(\omega,\.) = \v\phi(\.)^T\v{w}(\omega)$ where $w_i\~[N](0,1)$, we can write
\[
(f\given\v{y}) \approx \v\phi(\.)^T(\v{w}(\omega) + \v{\tilde{v}}(\omega))
\]
where $\v{\tilde{v}}(\omega) = \v{w}(\omega) + \v\phi(\v{x}) (\v\phi(\v{x})^T\v\phi(\v{x}) + \m\Sigma)^{-1}(\v\gamma - \v{\tilde{f}}(\omega) - \v\eps(\omega))$ are random weights.
Therefore, if change the model, then the posterior becomes a sum of the specified finite basis functions, irrespective of the data, and in particular does not grow as data size increases.

This therefore means its representational capacity---in the sense of the dimension of the vector space spanned by all basis functions used---also does not grow as data size increases.
This is to be contrasted with the approximate pathwise update, for which this dimensionality grows due to the presence of $n$ kernel functions $k(x_j,\.)$ in the sum.

\caption{Example of the \emph{variance starvation} phenomenon in two different random Fourier feature models (solid), compared to the true posterior (dashed).
We see two problems: the mean spuriously oscillates and the error bars grow too slowly away from the data.
This can cause the UCB acquisition, which is global minima of the error bars, to appear in the completely wrong location.
With the given hyperparameter choices, $n=10$ data points is enough to exhibit considerable approximation error.}
\label{fig:variance-starvation}
\end{figure}

The result is that if the true posterior takes on a difficult-to-represent shape---which will often be the case if $n$ is large enough, but can also occur even if it is not---then performance degrades disastrously.
This can be seen in \Cref{fig:variance-starvation}.
This phenomenon has been called \emph{variance starvation} in the literature, due to its ability to produce error bars that are too narrow as a result of lack of representational capacity---we note this name is misleading because it is also capable of producing error bars which are far too large.

A number of ways of alleviating Variance starvation have been proposed in the literature.
One is to avoid using Fourier bases for representing the posterior, and rely instead on basis functions which are compactly supported or otherwise possess some sense of locality.
This mirrors ideas in numerical analysis surrounding \emph{Runge's phenomenon}, where similar behavior occurs in polynomial interpolation.
From this angle, the pathwise viewpoint offers a canonical way to select the functions used for representing the data.

By not approximating terms that do not need to be approximated, pathwise approximations avoid limiting representational capacity and thus retain performance.
Variance starvation has been an ongoing difficulty in Bayesian optimization algorithms for some time---in our view, pathwise approximations of the kind described here largely resolve the issue.


\section{Error analysis}

Pathwise posterior approximations are, ultimately, approximations.
Therefore, a key question one can ask is: how accurate are they?
To quantify this, we need an appropriate notion of \emph{distance} to quantify how far away the two random variables of interest are.
This notion should possess a number of key properties.

\1  It should be \emph{distributional} in nature to reflect the fact that it is the information contained in the posterior that is of interest to us, rather than the precise way in which the random variables are generated.
\2 The distance between the true posterior and pathwise approximations should be finite, in order to facilitate meaningful comparisons.
\0 

The \emphmarginnote{Wasserstein distance} on the space of probability measures is defined as 
\[
W_{k,d}(\pi,\pi')^k = \inf_{\gamma\in\Gamma(\pi,\pi')} \int_{A\x A} d(a,a')^k \d\gamma(a,a')
\]
where $d$ is a metric on $A$, and $\Gamma(\pi,\pi')$ is this set of all \emph{couplings} of $\pi$ with $\pi'$, namely probability measured $\gamma$ supported on $A\x A$ whose marginals equal $\pi$ and $\pi'$.
We adopt this expression as our notion of distance.

The Wasserstein distance can be understood as the expected distance between two random variables $a$ and $a'$, with distributions $\pi$ and $\pi'$, where the random numbers used to generate $a$ and $a'$ are linked in order to make the expectation as small as possible.
The smallest possible expected distance is zero, which only occurs if the random variables can be made identical to one another---or, in other words, if their distributions coincide.

This definition satisfies both requirements. 
By virtue of varying random numbers---or, more precisely, optimizing over couplings---it compares distributions.
Moreover, unlike alternatives such as the Kullback--Leibler divergence or total variation distance, Wasserstein distances metrize the topology of weak convergence, do not impose restrictive absolute continuity requirements, and are finite in the cases of interest.

We will also analyze error in a second way: using the supremum norm between kernels.
Observe that pathwise approximations under mean-zero priors possess the exact same mean as the true posterior.
Therefore, when restricted to pathwise approximations under mean-zero priors, this notion lifts to a \emph{metric} rather than a pseudometric between probability distributions in the given class.
We now state our main result.

\begin{proposition}[Pathwise posterior Wasserstein error bound]
\label{prop:wasserstein-bound}
Assume $X \subseteq \R^d$ is compact and that $f \~[GP](0,k)$ is almost surely continuous.
Let $\tl{f}(\omega,x) = \sum_{i=1}^\ell w_i(\omega) \phi_i(x)$, and let $(\tl{f}\given\v{y})(\omega,x) = \tl{f}(\omega,x) + \m{K}_{(\.)\v{x}}\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1}(\v{y}- \tl{f}(\v{x}))$.
Then we have 
\[
W_{2,L^2(X)}(\tl{f}\given\v{y}, f\given\v{y}) \leq C_1 W_{2,C(X)}(\tl{f},f)
\]
where $C_1 = \del{2\f{vol}(X)\del{1 + \norm{k}^2_{C(X\x X)} \norm{\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1}}^2_{L(\ell^\infty;\ell^1}}}^{1/2}$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The idea is to first use the pathwise update to prove a pointwise bound, then take expectations with respect to a minimizing coupling to obtain a Wasserstein bound.
Using H√∂lder's inequality with $p=1$ and $q=\infty$, write 
\[
&\abs[1]{(\tl{f}\given\v{y})(\.) - (f\given\v{y})(\.)}^2 
\\
&\qquad\leq 2 \abs[1]{\tl{f}(\.) - f(\.)}^2 + 2 \abs[1]{\m{K}_{(\.)\v{x}}\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1} (\tl{f}(\v{x}) - f(\v{x}))}^2
\\
&\qquad\leq 2\norm[1]{\tl{f} - f}^2_{L^\infty(X)} + 2 \norm[1]{\m{K}_{(\.)\v{x}}\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1}}^2_{\ell^1} \norm[1]{\tl{f}(\v{x}) - f(\v{x})}^2_{\ell^\infty}
\\ 
&\qquad\leq 2 \del{1 + \norm[1]{\m{K}_{(\.)\v{x}}}^2_{\ell^\infty} \norm[1]{\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1}}^2_{L(\ell^\infty;\ell^1)}} \norm[1]{\tl{f} - f}^2_{L^\infty(X)}
\\ 
&\qquad\leq \ubr{2 \del{1 + \norm[1]{k}^2_{C(X\x X)} \norm[1]{\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1}}^2_{L(\ell^\infty;\ell^1)}}}_{C_0} \norm[1]{\tl{f} - f}^2_{C(X)}
\]
where $\norm{\.}_{L(A;B)}$ is the operator norm between $A$ and $B$, and where we have used almost sure continuity of sample paths to replace $\norm{\.}_{L^\infty(X)}$ with $\norm{\.}_{C(X)}$.
We now lift this bound to a bound on the Wasserstein distance by integrating both sides with respect to an optimal coupling $\gamma\in\Gamma(\tl\pi,\pi)$, where $\tl\pi$ and $\pi$ are the distributions of $\tl{f}$ and $f$, respectively.
Writing
\[
W_{2,L^2(X)}(\tl{f}\given\v{y}, f\given\v{y})^2 &= \inf_{\gamma\in\Gamma(\tl\pi, \pi)} \E_\gamma \norm[1]{(\tl{f}\given\v{y}) - (f\given\v{y})}^2_{L^2(X)}
\\
&\leq C_0 \vol(X) \inf_{\gamma\in\Gamma(\tl\pi, \pi)} \E_\gamma \norm[1]{\tl{f} - f}_{C(X)}
\\
&\leq C_1^2 W_{2,C(X)}(\tl{f},f)^2
\]
and noting that $C(X)$ is a separable metric space, which ensures that the Wasserstein distance over it is well-defined, gives the claim.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}[Pathwise posterior kernel error bound]
\label{prop:kernel_bound}
Under the same assumptions as \Cref{prop:wasserstein-bound}, letting $k^{(f\given\v{y})}$, $k^{(\tl{f}\given\v{y})}$, and $k^{(\tl{f})}$ be the covariance kernel of these respective processes, we have
\[
\norm[1]{k^{(\tl{f}\given\v{y})} - k^{(f\given\v{y})}}_{C(X\x X)} \leq C_2 \norm[1]{k^{(\tl{f})} - k}_{C(X\x X)}
\]
where $C_2 = n\del{1 + \norm[1]{k}_{C(X\x X)} \norm[1]{\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}}_{L(\ell^\infty;\ell^1)}}^2$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The idea is again to apply standard function-analytic inequalities to the pathwise update.
For a kernel $k$, define the linear operator $M_k : C(X \x X) \-> C(X \x X)$ by
\[
(M_k c)(\.,\.') &= c(\.,\.') - c(\.,\v{x})\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1}\m{K}_{\v{x}(\.)} - \m{K}_{(\.)\v{x}}\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1}c(\v{x},\.)
\\
&\qquad+ \m{K}_{(\.)\v{x}}\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1} c(\v{x},\v{x}) \m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1}\m{K}_{\v{x}(\.)}
.
\]
By construction, we have that 
\[
k^{(f\given\v{y})} &= M_k k
&
k^{(\tl{f}\given\v{y})} &= M_k k^{(\tl{f})}
.
\]
Thus, it suffices to prove that $M_k$ is bounded and calculate its operator norm.
To do so, write 
\[
\norm[1]{M_k c}_{C(X \x X)} &\leq \norm[1]{c}_{C(X \x X)} + 2 \norm[1]{c(\.,\v{x})\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1}\m{K}_{\v{x}(\.)}}_{C(X \x X)}
\\
&\qquad+ \norm[1]{\m{K}_{(\.)\v{x}}\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1} c(\v{x},\v{x}) \m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1}\m{K}_{\v{x}(\.)}}_{C(X \x X)}
.
\]
We bound these term-by-term.
For the second term, using H√∂lder's inequality with $p=1$ and $q=\infty$, write 
\[
&\norm[1]{c(\.,\v{x})\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1}\m{K}_{\v{x}(\.)}}_{C(X \x X)}
\\
&\qquad= \sup_{\v{x}',\v{x}'' \in X} c(\v{x}',\v{x})\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1}\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}''}
\\
&\qquad\leq \sup_{\v{x}',\v{x}'' \in X} \norm[1]{c(\v{x}',\v{x})}_{\ell^\infty} \norm[1]{\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1}}_{L(\ell^\infty;\ell^1)} \norm[1]{\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}''}}_{\ell^\infty}
\\
&\qquad\leq \norm[1]{c}_{C(X \x X)} \norm[1]{\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1}}_{L(\ell^\infty;\ell^1)} \norm[1]{k}_{C(X \x X)}
\]
where we have used continuity of $k$ to obtain the last inequality.
For the third term, similarly, write 
\[
&\norm[1]{\m{K}_{(\.)\v{x}}\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1} c(\v{x},\v{x}) \m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1}\m{K}_{\v{x}(\.)}}_{C(X \x X)}
\\
&\qquad= \sup_{\v{x}',\v{x}'' \in X} c(\v{x}',\v{x}) \m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1} c(\v{x},\v{x}) \m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1} c(\v{x},\v{x}'')
\\
&\qquad \leq \norm[1]{k}^2_{C(X \x X)} \norm[1]{\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1} c(\v{x},\v{x}) \m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1}}_{L(\ell^\infty;\ell^1)}
\\
&\qquad \leq n \norm[1]{k}^2_{C(X \x X)} \norm[1]{\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1}}^2_{L(\ell^\infty;\ell^1)} \norm{c}_{C(X \x X)}
\]
where $n$ factor appears due to use of $\norm[1]{\.}_{L(\ell^\infty;\ell^1)}$.
Putting these inequalities together gives 
\[
&\frac{\norm[1]{M_k c}_{C(X \x X)}}{\norm{c}_{C(X \x X)}}
\\
&\quad\leq \del{1 + 2 \norm[1]{\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1}}_{L(\ell^\infty;\ell^1)} \norm[1]{k}_{C(X \x X)} + n \norm[1]{\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1}}^2_{L(\ell^\infty;\ell^1)} \norm[1]{k}^2_{C(X \x X)}} 
\\
&\quad\leq n \del{1 + \norm[1]{\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1}}_{L(\ell^\infty;\ell^1)} \norm[1]{k}_{C(X \x X)}}^2
\]
and so the claim follows.
\end{proof}

The above arguments shows that, for a given dataset size, posterior approximation error is controlled by prior approximation error.
Thus, if we increase approximation accuracy in the prior, we are guaranteed to also increase approximation accuracy in the posterior, both in the limit and outside it.

The key idea in the above arguments was to analyze the pathwise approximation by applying standard function-analytic inequalities to the pathwise representation itself.
By varying the resulting norms, a wide set of similar inequalities follow: we make no attempt to optimize bounds, and instead focus on presenting the technique in the simplest manner.

\parmarginnote{Approximation error and asymptotic posterior contraction}
The bounds presented are not tight, particularly in large-data settings where the inverse matrix norm in the constant becomes large.
This may tempt one to conclude that approximation error will grow, but this is often false---instead, the bound becomes loose.
One way to see this is by considering posterior contraction: in large-data settings, the posterior will be concentrated, and since our approximations are exact with respect to the mean, there is little room left for error, in the absolute sense, to accumulate.

Different prior approximations possess different error behavior.
The random Fourier feature approach is particularly attractive because its Monte Carlo nature makes it decay at a dimension-free rate of $\sqrt{\ell}$: \textcite{sutherland15} provide bounds on this term.
Note also that the terms in our kernel bounds depend on the dimension only through the kernel matrix, which itself depends on the dimension of the data and not the ambient space.
In this sense, our bounds are very well-behaved with respect to dimension.

This concludes our theoretical presentation and analysis.
We now move to evaluating these ideas in practical settings, and discussing the broad picture painted by the ideas presented here and in the preceding sections.

\section{Parallel Thompson sampling}

We now study empirically how pathwise approximations affect downstream performance of Gaussian process models, using a simple experiment to showcase the key behavior.
For this, we perform a Bayesian optimization experiment using parallel Thompson sampling for acquisition.
This variant of Thompson sampling consists of sampling $p$ independent posterior draws, then computing the acquisition and evaluating the target function at each location simultaneously.
Specifically, for $s=1,..,p$, define
\[
x_{t+1,s}(\omega) &= \argmin_{x\in X} \phi_{t,s}(\omega,x)
&
\phi_{t,s}&\~ f \given y_1,..,y_t
\]
where $f$ is the Gaussian process.
The domain $X$ is taken to be the unit hypercube in dimensions $d = 2$, $d = 4$, and $d = 8$.
We use a Mat√©rn prior with unit variance, length scale $\kappa = \sqrt{d/100}$, and smoothness $\nu = 5/2$.
Each observation is assigned an independent Gaussian likelihood with error variance $\sigma^2 = 10^{-3}$.
This defines the Bayesian model.

We select target functions to minimize by sampling from a random Fourier feature approximation of the prior, and obtain their minima for purposes of regret using multi-start gradient descent.
To account for variable problem difficulty, we allow the number of evaluations to vary according to dimension, setting $n=64$ for $d=2$, $n = 256$ for $d = 4$, and $n = 1024$ for $d = 8$.
Similarly, we set the degree of parallelism to allow $p = d$ simultaneous evaluations.
We repeat each experiment $32$ times to assess variability.

We consider two sequential baselines and three approximate acquisition strategies using the posterior Gaussian process.
For the sequential baselines, we use \emph{random search} \cite{bergstra12} and \emph{dividing rectangles} \cite{jones93}, selected for their simplicity.
For the Gaussian process baselines, we consider (a) a \emph{Cholesky} grid-based approach, (b) a \emph{random Fourier feature} posterior process, and (c) a \emph{pathwise} approximate posterior using the same Fourier feature approximation for the prior term.
We now describe these in more detail.

\begin{figure*}[p!]
\input{figures/tex/ts.tex}
\caption{Parallel Thompson sampling benchmark results.}
\label{fig:results-ts}
\end{figure*}

The Cholesky grid-based approach works by (i) drawing a set with $250,000$ points uniformly at random, (ii) sampling a vector of independent Gaussians whose mean and variance are equal to the posterior predictive distribution at those points, (iii) choosing the $2048$ smallest elements, (iv) sampling the posterior Gaussian process jointly at the chosen locations, and (v) choosing the smallest value.
This gives an approximation to the true acquisition locations using the candidate locations on the grid.

The random Fourier feature and pathwise approximate posterior approaches do not use grids.
Instead, we (i) draw a set of $250,000$ points uniformly at random, (ii) evaluate $f \given \v{y}$ at those locations to choose the $32$ smallest points, and (iii) run multi-start optimization using L-BFGS-B \cite{byrd95} from each candidate location to find the minima.
This procedure is selected so as to be relatively similar to the grid-based approach and ensure a fair comparison.


To understand the effect of posterior approximation, we examine both basis-function-based Gaussian processes with a total of $\ell = 256$, $\ell = 1024$, and $\ell = 4096$ basis functions.
For the pathwise approximate posterior, this is the sum of both the number of basis functions used for the prior with the number of canonical basis functions---this choice helps avoid unfairly penalizing the random fourier Feature model.
We use random-phase-based Fourier features in both approximate posteriors.

Results can be seen in \Cref{fig:results-ts}, where we plot regret curves 
Immediately, we see that the effect of the strategy used for computing the acqusition function varies according to dimension.

In the two-dimensional setting, all Gaussian process methods perform comparably, outperforming the random search and dividing rectangles baselines.
This occurs even in the regime with $\ell = 256$ basis functions, and shows that posterior approximation error does not play a particularly significant role for the given comparisons and parameters.

In the four-dimensional setting, the behavior is different.
This time, in the $\ell = 256$ case, the pathwise approximate posterior outperforms both other Gaussian process baselines.
Here, the random Fourier feature baseline performs worse than the Cholesky baseline.
If we increase the amount of basis functions, the random Fourier feature baseline recovers this difference, yielding relatively comparable performance to the pathwise approximation for $\ell = 1024$ and $\ell = 4096$, and outperforming the Cholesky baseline.

In the eight-dimensional setting, the pathwise approximation outperforms all baselines for $\ell = 256$ and $\ell = 1024$.
In those cases, both the random Fourier feature and Cholesky baselines are hampered by the curse of dimensionality, and perform no better than the dividing rectangles baseline---for $\ell = 256$, random Fourier features are comparable to random search.
With $\ell = 4096$ basis functions, the performance of Fourier features recovers.
In contrast, the pathwise approximation is insensitive to the number of basis functions.

In summary, these results largely confirm the viewpoint developed using the preceding theory.
We saw previously that the pathwise approximate posterior can be seen as modfying the random Fourier feature posterior by replacing certain Monte Carlo approximations with their expected values.
It is therefore reasonable to suppose that this gives a more accurate approximation of the true posterior.
Our results are thus consistent with the true Gaussian process being a better-performing model for Bayesian optimization.

For the Mat√©rn prior used, this mirrors understanding in the current literature: low-rank and other finite-dimensional models are generally less expressive than true Gaussian processes and mostly favored in cases where their properties help control computational costs.
Such analysis has been performed for variational Gaussian processes, Fourier feature methods, and many others.

The benefits of using a method that avoids solving arbitrarily large linear systems at test-time are clear from the point of view of both computational complexity and numerical stability.
From these perspectives, our results show that already in $d=4$ the improvements are enough to make a noticeable difference in downstream tasks.


\section{Discussion}

In the Gaussian case, the distributional notion of \emph{conditioning} can be re-formualted using random variables, yielding a notion of \emph{pathwise conditioning}.
In the preceding sections, we developed and studied this point of view for Gaussian processes, allowing us to express a posterior Gaussian process as the sum of a \emph{prior term}, and a \emph{data-dependent term}.

Pathwise conditioning gives a powerful way to think about posterior Gaussian processes.
Using this notion, we re-interpreted classical methods such as \emph{random Fourier features} and \emph{inducing points}, by observing that they correspond to approximations made to individual terms within the pathwise update.
Crucially, we observed that one could approximate different terms within the formula individually.

Using this observation, we constructed accurate finite-dimensional posterior approximations which nonetheless yield actual \emph{random functions}.
These functions are sums of two sets of finite basis functions with dependent random coefficients.
These coefficients can be sampled in advance, after which the functions effectively become deterministic and can be evaluated at arbitrary points, as well as differentiated using standard techniques.

The resulting approximations are particularly useful in decision-making settings such as \emph{Bayesian optimization}, where acquisition functions constructed from Gaussian process sample paths need to be optimized or evaluated at arbitrary locations.
This makes it possible to implement Thompson sampling using automatic differentiation in a straightforward manner without any sophisticated bookkeeping.
In particular, there is no need to track at what points the Gaussian process has already been evaluated at.

Using the presented technique, minimizing a Gaussian process sample path can be done in linear time and without incurring large approximation error that degrades performance as part of the iterative minimization procedure itself.
This is particularly useful in higher-dimensional settings, where grid-based methods and other alternatives may be hampered by the curse of dimensionality.

The performance of pathwise approximate posterior Gaussian processes depends on the approximation accuracy of the prior term.
We presented a number of methods for doing so, each suited to their respective settings.
For stationary kernels, random Fourier feature methods are particularly attractive due to their good behavior with respect to dimension, but are by no means the only choice.
We hope these developments prompt further study of other possible choices for approximate priors.

Pathwise approximations are also of interst as a potential organizing principle for designing interfaces in Gaussian process software packages.
In particular, one can consider implementing a Gaussian processes with separate methods for evaluating the process and re-sampling its random weights.
Depending on the application and user preference, this might be much more convenient than working with distributions at user-specified locations.
Exploring these alternatives is a promising avenue for further work.

Similarly, pathwise approximations make a strong case that efficiently sampling from a Gaussian process prior is a key software primitive that a Gaussian process package should support as part of its kernel implementations. 
Understanding how to organize different approximations, which may possess different properties and may also be computed in different ways, is another promising avenue for future work.

Gaussian processes have been applied in many settings, ranging from areas such as spatial statistics where they are mostly used by humans, to areas such as Bayesian optimization and model-based reinforcement learning where they are mostly used by computers.
We hope that the contributions presented here improve their ease of use, broaden their applicability, and enable new applications not yet considered.
We now proceed to study a different avenue for expanding the set of settings Gaussian processes can be applied in.








\chapter{Non-Euclidean Mat√©rn Gaussian Processes}
\label{ch:noneuclidean}

\lettrine{S}{tationary kernels} on Euclidean spaces are presently the most widely-used Gaussian process model class.
These kernels are attractive because they work effectively and it is generally easy to understand the kind of prior information they introduce into a problem.
This makes them a valuable tool for practitioners to use in the manner required for the task at hand.

Our goal throughout has been to expand the settings in which Gaussian process models and decision systems built atop them can be used.
We have so far focused on doing so by making existing models easier to work with, but now pursue a different approach: namely, we focus on expanding the scope of models one can consider to begin with.
We will again emphasize on constructiveness and making abstract ideas accessible to the practitioner.

We focus on the setting of Riemannian geometry, which describes a widely-occurring class of geometric shapes and spaces.
We thus study Gaussian processes whose domains are manifolds, rather than Euclidean spaces.
Working with manifolds often involves thinking carefully about discretization: we therefore also study purely discrete settings involving meshes and weighted undirected graphs, which are of inherent interest in their own right.

Our guiding theme will be: how can we make Gaussian processes on Riemannian manifolds be just as effective a model class as their Euclidean counterparts?
We now proceed to introduce, develop, and explore this topic.


\section{Riemannian Mat√©rn Gaussian Processes}

We begin with a key question: how should one generalize the most widely-used class of Gaussian process models to the Riemannian manifold setting?
There are multiple potential definitions one can introduce, some of which will turn out to be much better-behaved mathematically than others.
In order to pursue these questions, we begin by introducing and reviewing the setting of differential geometry.

\subsection{Review of differential geometry}
We now briefly review the notions needed to define and understand manifolds.\footnote{The Russian word for \emph{manifold} is \emph{mnogoobrazie} (mn\rotatebox[origin=c]{180}{e}g\rotatebox[origin=c]{180}{aa}br{\textquotesingle}az\textsuperscript{j}\textsc{i}j\rotatebox[origin=c]{180}{e}). The word \emph{mnogo} means \emph{many}, and the word \emph{obraz} roughly means \emph{form}, \emph{view}, or \emph{image}. 
Thus, a \emph{manifold} is a \emph{space with many views into it}, which I find to be well-chosen and evocative.}
These are sets equipped with additional structure encoding their geometric shape.

A \emphmarginnote{topological space} is a set $X$ together with a \emph{topology}, which is a collection of subsets $\c{O}_X \subseteq 2^X$ called the \emph{open sets}---these include the empty set, the space itself, and are closed under pairwise intersections and arbitrary unions.
A given set generally admits many topologies.
Topological spaces admit notions of \emph{locality}, \emph{convergence}, \emph{continuity}, \emph{compactness}, \emph{paracompactness}, \emph{denseness}, and many others.
The \emph{Hausdorff} property implies that limits are unique.

\parmarginnote{Topological manifold}
A paracompact Hausdorff topological space $(X,\c{O}_X)$ is called a $d$-dimensional \emph{topological manifold} if it is locally homeomorphic to $\R^d$ equipped with the standard topology.
For such a manifold, there is a set $\c{A}_X$ called the \emph{atlas} whose elements are the local homeomorphisms, called \emph{charts}.
An atlas is \emph{maximal} if it is the largest possible such set: for any given atlas, a maximal atlas containing it it is unique.

A \emphmarginnote{smooth differentiable manifold} is a triple  $(X,\c{O}_X,\c{A}_X)$ where $X$ is a topological manifold, and $\c{A}_X$ is a $C^\infty$-atlas.
A $C^\infty$-atlas is an atlas in which, for any charts $x,y \in \c{A}_X$ with overlapping domain, the \emph{chart transition map} $y\after x^{-1}$ is an infinitely differentiable function.
Homeomorphisms compatible with such charts are called \emph{diffeomorphisms}.
A smooth manifold is called \emph{oriented} if the Jacobian determinant of all chart transition maps in its atlas is positive.
Such atlases admit maximal analogs.

A \emphmarginnote{manifold with boundary} is one of a wide class of spaces generalizing the notion of a manifold while preserving most geometric characteristics that make manifolds useful and interesting in the first place.
Such a space is defined analogously to an ordinary manifold, except that it is also possible for it to be locally homeommorphic to a Euclidean half-plane.
The ideas we consider admit natural generalizations to such settings, but we do not pursue these, and in particular only consider manifolds without boundary.

Every smooth manifold $X$ gives rise to its \emphmarginnote{tangent bundle} $(TX,\proj_X,X)$, which contains a smooth manifold $TX$ and a surjective projection map $\proj_X : TX \-> X$.
The former is defined as $TX = \U_{x\in X} \{(x,v) : v \in T_x X\}$, where $T_x X$ is the tangent space, defined as a vector space of equivalence classes of directional derivatives of smooth curves through $x$.
This set can be equipped with the structure of a smooth manifold, arising canonically from the smooth structure of $X$.

A map $f : X \-> TX$ satisfying $\proj_X \after f = \id_X$ is called a \emphmarginnote{vector field}.
Note that this is \emph{not the same} as a map $X \-> \R^d$ and often cannot usefully be expressed in this way: we expand on this in the sequel.
If $f$ is smooth, we write $f \in \Gamma(TX)$.
We also say that $f$ is a \emph{cross-section}, or simply a \emphmarginnote{section}, of the tangent bundle.
Functions can multiply against vector fields by scaling them pointwise.

Analogously, we can define the \emphmarginnote{cotangent bundle} $T^* X = \U_{x\in X} \{(x,\phi) : \phi \in T_x X^*\}$ where, compared to the tangent bundle, we have replaced the vector space $T_x X$ with its topological dual $T_x X^*$.
A smooth sections of this bundle is called a \emphmarginnote{covector field}.
We can similarly define a number of other bundles, each equipped with a projection map onto the base space.
Introducing sections of such bundles gives rise to the notion of a \emphmarginnote{tensor field} and other generalizations.

\parmarginnote{Interior product}
Vector fields can be inserted into covector fields by pairing vectors in each tangent space: this defines the \emph{interior product} $\mathbin{\lrcorner}$, which extends to tensor fields as long as the pairing being considered makes logical sense.
We say that a totally antisymmetric $(0,k)$-tensor field is a $k$-form, and that a smooth function is a $0$-form.
The \emphmarginnote{exterior derivative}, denoted by $\d$, maps $k$-forms into $(k+1)$-forms.
Interior products preserve antisymmetry.

\parmarginnote{Volume}
Differential forms are often used to formalize and encode geometric structure in a way that is amenable to analysis.
For example, a nowhere-vanishing $d$-form is called a \emph{volume form}---such a form induces a notion of a \emph{volume density}, which induces a notion of \emphmarginnote{integration} of smooth functions, and in turn, by the Riesz--Markov--Kakutani representation theorem, a Radon measure on the manifold, which we call the \emph{volume measure}.
On a general smooth manifold, the choice of a volume form is heavily non-unique.

A \emphmarginnote{Riemannian manifold} is a quadruple $(X,\c{O}_X,\c{A}_X,g)$, usually written $(X,g)$, where $X$ is a smooth manifold and $g$ is the \emph{metric tensor}, which is a smooth non-degenerate symmetric positive definite $(0,2)$-tensor field.
The metric tensor can be thought of as an algebraic object encoding the manifold's quantitative shape, and \emph{canonically} give rise to notions such as \emph{volume}, \emph{integration}, and \emph{geodesics}.
In particular, we denote both the volume measure and volume density induced by the metric tensor as $\vol_g$.

\parmarginnote{Nash Embedding}
Riemannian manifolds are, by definition, topological spaces with additional structure.
By Nash's Embedding Theorem, every Riemannian manifold can be isometrically embedded within a $(2d+1)$-dimensional Euclidean space.
This identifies Riemannian manifolds as geometric shapes located within Euclidean spaces.
This perspective is often avoided for both technical and conceptual reasons: if the spacetime of the universe is a manifold, can an ambient space actually have physical meaning?

\subsection{The Laplace--Beltrami operator}

Riemannian manifolds admit many different objects, such as connection one-forms and Ricci tensors, which encode and mathematically describe their geometric properties.
These objects are generally built using the metric along with derivatives and other algebraic operations.
The \emph{Laplace--Beltrami operator} is one such object, and forms a basic building block for defining differentual equations on manifolds.

\begin{definition}[Laplace--Beltrami operator]
Let $(X,g)$ be an Riemannian manifold.
Define the \emph{divergence} of a vector field to be the unique map 
\[
\f{div}_g : \Gamma(TX) &\-> C^\infty(X)
&
\d(v \mathbin{\lrcorner} \vol_g)  &=  \f{div}_g v\.\vol_g
\quad
\forall v \in \Gamma(TX)
\]
where $\.$ is pointwise multiplication of $k$-densities by smooth functions, and the \emph{gradient} of a scalar function to be the unique map 
\[
\f{grad}_g : C^\infty(X) &\-> \Gamma(TX)
&
g(\f{grad}_g f,v) &= (\d f) \mathbin{\lrcorner} v
\quad
\forall v \in \Gamma(TX)
.
\]
Define the \emph{Laplace--Beltrami operator} to be 
\[
\lap_g : C^\infty(X) &\-> C^\infty(X)
&
\lap_g f &= \f{div}_g \f{grad}_g f
.
\]
\end{definition}

The Laplace--Beltrami operator, then, maps functions into the divergence of their gradient at every point.
There are multiple equivalent ways of defining the Laplace--Beltrami operator: an alternative is to define is as the trace of the Riemannian Hessian, and another is to define it in coordinates.
The latter expression illustrates that a Laplace--Beltrami operator maps functions into their locally averaged analogs, in a sense.
For us, the relatively rich spectral properties possessed by this operator will be of key interest.

\begin{result}
Let $(X,g)$ be a compact Riemannian manifold.
Then the operator $-\lap_g : C^\infty(X) \-> C^\infty(X)$ extends uniquely to a self-adjoint unbounded positive operator $-\lap_g: D(\lap_g) \-> L^2(X)$, where $D(\lap_g) \subseteq L^2(X)$.
\end{result}

\begin{proof}
Note first that by compactness and lack of boundary, we have an injection $C^\infty(X) = C^\infty_c(X) \embeds L^2(X)$, enabling us to reinterpret the classical Laplace--Beltrami operator as a map $-\lap_g : C^\infty(X) \-> L^2(X)$.
The remaining claim follows from \textcite[Theorem 2.4]{strichartz83}.
\end{proof}

Viewed in this way, the range of the Laplace--Beltrami operator is a Hilbert space, enabling us to use ideas from spectral theory to better understand its behavior.
In particular, one can show that, owing to compactness, the spectrum of $-\lap_g$ is discrete---this gives a particularly simple view of $-\lap_g$ thorugh its eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.

\begin{result}[Sturm--Liouville decomposition]
Let $(X,g)$ be a compact Riemannian manifold.
Then there exists an orthonormal basis $f_n$, $n\in\Z_+$, of $L^2(X)$ such that $-\lap_g f_n = \lambda_n f_n$ with $0 = \lambda_0 \leq \lambda_1 \leq .. \leq \lambda_n$ and $\lambda_n\-> \infty$ as $n\->\infty$.
Moreover, $-\lap_g$ admits the representation
\[
-\lap_g f = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \lambda_n \innerprod{f}{f_n} f_n
\]
which converges unconditionally in $L^2(X)$ for all $f \in D(\lap_g)$.
\end{result}

\begin{proof}
See \textcite[page 139]{chavel84} or \textcite[Theorem 44]{canzani13}.\footnote{TODO: fix this awful in-text citation format}.
\end{proof}

This is a powerful result for many reasons: the eigenfunctions $f_n$ can be viewed as analogs of the Fourier basis adapted to the manifold's geometry.
By expanding a function within the basis of eigenfunctions, we obtain an infinite sequence of basis coefficients---just like representing a periodic function $L^2([-\pi,\pi];\R)$ by an infinite sum of complex exponentials.
One reason of particular interest for our purposes is that the Sturm--Liouvile decomposition gives rise to a notion of \emph{functional calculus}, which we now introduce.


\begin{figure}
\vspace*{10ex}

\caption{Eigenfunctions of the Laplace--Beltrami operator on a sphere and dragon manifold.}
\end{figure}

\begin{definition}[Functional calculus]
Let $\Phi : [0,\infty) \-> \R$. 
Define the (possibly unbounded) operator $\Phi(-\lap_g) : D(\Phi(-\lap_g)) \-> L^2(X)$ by
\[
\Phi(-\lap_g) f = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \Phi(\lambda_n) \innerprod{f}{f_n} f_n
\]
where $D(\Phi(-\lap_g)) = \{f \in L^2(X) : \sum_{n=0}^\infty \abs{\Phi(\lambda_n)}^2 \abs{\innerprod{f}{f_n}}^2 f_n < \infty\}$.
\end{definition}

Functional calculus lets us extend the idea of applying functions from numbers to operators.
This is done by applying the function of interest to the eigenvalues of the operator.
We will use this to construct Gaussian processes as solutions of stochastic partial differential equations.
First, however, we take a step back and examine why one would want to take this rather roundabout approach in the first place as opposed to a more direct alternative.

\subsection{A no-go theorem for kernels on manifolds}

Here, we begin exploring the idea of defining Gaussian processes whose domains are Riemannian manifolds.
Recall that to define such a Gaussian process, we need to define its kernel, which is a positive semi-definite function $k : X \x X \-> \R$.

Before attempting to do so in generality, consider first how to extend the Euclidean squared exponential kernel.
The simplest idea one can consider is to replace the Euclidean distance $\norm{x-x'}$ with the Riemannian geodesic distance $d_g(x,x')$.
This gives 
\[
\sigma^2 \exp\del{-\frac{d_g(x,x')^2}{2\kappa^2}}
\]
as a candidate kernel.
We must then ask: is this expression necessarily well-defined? 
In particular, is it positive semi-definite for all $\kappa$?

In the Euclidean setting, we can prove positive-semi-definiteness by first proving it for linear kernels, then showing sums, products, and limits of kernels are positive semi-definite, thereby constructing the kernel piece-by-piece.
The argument clearly cannot extend to the manifold setting, where there are no linear kernels.
It turns out that no argument can, because in the manifold setting the corresponding claim isn't true.

\begin{result}
Let $(X,g)$ be a complete Riemannian manifold.
If the geodesic squared exponential kernel is positive semi-definite for all $\kappa > 0$, then $X$ is isometric to a Euclidean space.
\end{result}

\begin{proof}
\textcite[Theorem 2]{feragen15}.
\end{proof}

It turns out that even more can be said.
In a metric space $(X,d)$, the \emph{length} of a path  $\gamma : [0,L] \-> X$ is defined as the least upper bound on the total distance between finite sets of successive points along the curve.
A path is called \emph{geodesic} between $x$ and $x'$ if $\gamma(0) = x$, $\gamma(L) = x'$, and $d(\gamma(t),\gamma(t')) = |t - t'|$ for all $t,t'\in[0,L]$.
A metric space is called a \emph{geodesic space} if every pair of points is connected by a geodesic.

\begin{result}
Let $(X,d)$ be a geodesic space.
If the geodesic squared exponential kernel is positive semi-definite for all $\kappa > 0$, then $X$ is flat in the sense of Alexandrov.
\end{result}

\begin{proof}
\textcite[Theorem 2]{feragen15}.
\end{proof}

See \textcite[Chapter 26]{villani08} for a definition of flatness in the above sense, and a discussion on its interpretation and relationship to various notions of curvature.
Complete Riemannian manifolds are geodesic spaces, but the former result is sharper than the latter: in particular, the torus equipped with the product metric is flat, but is not isometric to a Euclidean space.

These results are an absolute disaster for the geodesic squared exponential kernel, and give good reason to completely abandon this approach.
The fundamental issue is that there are few useful tools for proving positive-semi-definiteness of geodesic kernels, and, in light of the above results, it isn't obvious which functions are going to be positive semi-definite in the first place and which are not.
We therefore explore the alternative, differential-equation-based approach briefly mentioned in the preceding section.

\subsection{Stochastic partial differential equations}

We now develop an appropriate formalism for defining Gaussian processes on Riemannian manifolds.
Rather than building such processes by defining kernels, loosely speaking, we construct them directly as affine maps of white noise measures, which we think of as infinite-dimensional standard Gaussians.
This yields positive semi-definite kernels implicitly defined as covariances of said processes.

We begin by recalling key notions of abstract Gaussian processes defined on general vector spaces.
Specifically, we work with Gaussian processes in the sense of duality whose space of test functionals is given by a Hilbert space.

\begin{definition}[Generalized Gaussian~field]
A \emph{centered generalized Gaussian field} $f$ over a Hilbert space $H$ is a stochastic process $f : \Omega \x H \-> \R$ satisfying two key properties.
\1 $\E(f(\.,h)) = 0$ for all $h \in H$.
\2 There exists a bounded linear self-adjoint non-negative operator $\c{K}$ on $H$, called the \emph{covariance operator}, such that 
\[
\E(f(\.,h)f(\.,h')) = \innerprod{\c{K}h}{h'}
\]
for all $h,h' \in H$.
\0 
\end{definition}

We will take the right-hand-sides of our stochastic partial differential equations to be such stochastic processes. 
Before continuing, we prove that in the case that $H$ is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, then generalized Gaussian fields can be reinterpreted as Gaussian processes in the classical sense.

\begin{proposition}
Let $f : \Omega \x H \-> \R$ be a centered generalized Gaussian field defined over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space $H$ with identity covariance operator.
Then letting $\f{ev}_x \in H^*$ be a pointwise evaluation functional and $\Psi : H \-> H^*$ be the bijective linear isometry given by the Riesz Representation Theorem, the stochastic process $f : \Omega \x X \-> \R$ defined by $f(\omega, x) = f(\omega,\Psi^{-1} \f{ev}_x)$ is a Gaussian process whose covariance is given by the reproducing kernel of $H$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
It is clear that the resulting map is a centered Gaussian process, so it suffices to compute its covariance.
Let $\f{ev}_x \in H^*$ and $\f{ev}_{x'} \in H^*$ be pointwise evaluation functionals.
Then
\[
\Cov(f(\.,x),f(\.,x')) &= \Cov(f(\.,\Psi^{-1} \f{ev}_x),f(\.,\Psi^{-1} \f{ev}_{x'})) 
\\
&= \innerprod{\Psi^{-1}\f{ev}_x}{\Psi^{-1}\f{ev}_{x'}}_H 
\\
&= \innerprod{\f{ev}_x}{\f{ev}_{x'}}_{H^*}
\\
&= k(x,x')
\]
using the reproducing property, and the claim follows.
\end{proof}

Note that the resulting Gaussian process in general will \emph{not} have sample paths in $H$ almost surely, not even up to a choice of version.
Sample paths will instead generally lie in a less regular function space---this subtlety provides much of the motivation behind introducing generalized Gaussian fields in the first place, rather than working purely in terms of sample paths.
In the other direction, if $k$ is a kernel, define the \emph{covariance operator} by 
\[
\c{K} : \phi \|> \int_X \phi(x)k(x,\.) \d x
.
\]
One can see that a centered Gaussian process $f : \Omega \x X \-> \R$ induces a centered generalized Gaussian field $f : \Omega \x H \-> \R$ with covariance operator $\c{K}$, provided that $H$ is chosen appropriately.
For instance, if $f$ is regular enough that its samples lie in $L^2(X)$ almost surely, one can take $H = L^2(X)$ and $\c{K}$ as above.
This clarifies how this general notion relates to Gaussian processes in the standard sense.
To continue, we introduce the notion of a \emph{solution} of a stochastic partial differential equation.

\begin{definition}[Stochastic partial differential equation]
Let $H$ be a Hilbert space, let $\c{L} : H \-> H'$ be a bounded linear operator, and let $\c{W}$ be a centered generalized Gaussian field on $H'$.
Then the zero-mean generalized Gaussian field $f$ over $H$ is a solution of the abstract stochastic partial differential equation 
\[
\c{L} f = \c{W}    
\]
if for every $h\in H'$ we have that 
\[
f(\omega,\c{L}^* h) = \c{W}(\omega,h)
\]
holds almost surely.
\end{definition}

For our purposes, it also suffices to replace the almost sure equality with equality in distribution. 
Eeven if one considers this weaker notion, the same kind of results and calculations follow in our setting, and work equally well in both cases.
We therefore do not dwell on this distinction.

The idea behind this definition is to take advantage of Gaussianity and use it to avoid even attempting to construct a pathwise solution theory on random variables.
Instead, the operator $\c{L}$ is thought of as a map between the associated Hilbert spaces: if one or both are function spaces admitting reproducing kernels, the generalized Gaussian fields respectively yield Gaussian processes in the classical sense.
In the given setting, this solution concept ends up being useful, thanks to the following general result.

\begin{result}[SPDE solution]
If $\c{L}$ is invertible, then
\[
f(\omega,h) = \c{W}(\omega, \c{L}^{-*} h)
\]
is the unique solution to $\c{L}f = \c{W}$.
\end{result}

\begin{proof}
\textcite[Theorem 4.2.2.]{lototsky17}.
\end{proof}

It is rather remarkable that such a minimalist solution theory, which relies very fundamentally on the fact that Gaussian processes are uniquely determined by their associated reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces or generalizations thereof, gives a description concrete enough for our purposes.
Indeed, this result generally determines but does not reveal what function space $f$ lies in as a random variable, along with its regularity properties such as continuity---however, for Bayesian learning, we don't actually need these.


For this construction to yield a Gaussian process in the classical sense, we should choose $H$ to be a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, since this lets us build the Gaussian processes of interest from pointwise evaluation functionals as described previously.
The main challenge, then, is finding appropriate spaces and operators in order to apply the above results.

\subsection{The Riemannian Mat√©rn kernel}

We now use the above results to define Riemannian Gaussian processes directly, and, following this, calculate their kernels in order to obtain workable numerical expressions.
To proceed, we need to make concrete choices for which Hilbert spaces for $H$, and which operators to use for $\c{L}$.
To do so, we study the class of equations considered by \textcite{whittle63} and \textcite{lindgren11}, which we now review.

Suppose temporarily that $X = \R^d$ is Euclidean.
In that setting, \textcite{whittle63} has shown that, if we suppose that $f$ is, in a purely formal sense, a solution to the stochastic partial differential equation
\[
\del{\frac{2\nu}{\kappa^2} - \lap}^{\frac{\nu}{2} + \frac{d}{4}} f = \c{W}
\]
then its covariance kernel must be the \emphmarginnote{Mat√©rn kernel}
\[
k_{\nu}(x,x') = \sigma^2 \frac{2^{1-\nu}}{\Gamma(\nu)} \del{\sqrt{2\nu} \frac{\norm{x-x'}}{\kappa}}^\nu K_\nu \del{\sqrt{2\nu} \frac{\norm{x-x'}}{\kappa}}
\]
where $\Gamma$ is the gamma function and $K_\nu$ is the modified Bessel function of the second kind \cite{gradshteyn14}.
This kernel is very well-studied and among the most widely-used Euclidean kernels in practice.
Building on this idea, \textcite{lindgren11} proposed a formalism based on Galerkin finite element analysis for giving precise meaning to such calculations, including treatment of boundary conditions and other considerations.


\begin{figure}

\vspace*{10ex}
\caption{The Mat√©rn-1/2 kernel $k_{1/2}(x,\.)$ defined on a sphere and dragon manifold, where the point $x$ is marked by a red dot.}
\end{figure}

In particular, \textcite{lindgren11} define the \emphmarginnote{Riemannian Mat√©rn kernel} to be the covariance kernel of the solutions of analogs of the above stochastic partial differential equation, where $\R^d$ is replaced with a Riemannian manifold $X$, and the Euclidean Laplacian $\lap$ is replaced by the Laplace--Beltrami operator $\lap_g$.
The resulting kernel is well-defined, but its definition is implicit: \textcite{lindgren11} provide techniques for training the resulting Gaussian processes via solving the stochastic partial differential equation numerically.

We develop an alternative, more constructive formalism.
This is done by improving on the above prior results in two ways: (1) we bypass finite element analysis by instead working with the previously-introduced theory of Gaussian stochastic partial differential equations described by \textcite{lototsky17}, and (2) we deduce numerical expressions for calculating the kernels of the resulting processes, enabling them to be trained using standard methods.
To start, we define the right-hand-side of our equations.

\begin{definition}[Riemannian white noise]
Define the \emph{white noise process} $\c{W}_g : \Omega \x L^2(X) \-> \R$ to be a centered generalized Gaussian field with covariance operator $\id : L^2(X) \-> L^2(X)$, where we recall that the inner product on $L^2(X)$ is defined by integration against the Riemannian volume measure.
By applying Kolmogorov's Extension Theorem to a family of finite-dimensioanl marginals indexed by $L^2(X)$, we conclude such a process exists and is well-defined.
\end{definition}

This stochastic process \emph{cannot} be viewed as a scalar-valued random function.
Though Kolmogorov's Extension Theorem does imply there is a random variable $\c{W}_g : \Omega \-> \R^{L^2(X)}$ whose finite-dimensional marginals coincide with $\c{W}_g : \Omega \x L^2(X) \-> \R$, this is next-to-useless because $\R^{L^2(X)}$ is highly irregular and we can say little about which subspace $\c{W}$ concentrates on without additional considersations that we may conveniently avoid.

Next, we define the left-hand-side of the stochastic partial differential equations under study, including the Hilbert spaces and operators $\c{L}$ of interest using functional calculus.
For this, a result on Riemannian reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces will be of key interest.

\begin{result}[Riemannian Sobolev and diffusion spaces]
\label{res:riemannian-sobolev}
Define the Riemannian Sobolev space $H^s(X)$ by
\[
H^s(X) = \cbr{f \in D'(X) : f = (1 - \lap_g)^{-s/2} h : h \in L^2(X)}
\]
and the Riemannian diffusion space $\c{H}^s(X)$ by
\[
\c{H}^s(X) = \cbr{f \in D'(X) : f = e^{\frac{s}{2}\lap_g} h : h \in L^2(X)}
\]
where the operators are defined using functional calculus.
Then $H^s(X)$ with $s > \frac{d}{4}$ and $\c{H}^s(X)$ with $s > 0$ are reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.
\end{result}

\begin{proof}
\textcite[Theorem 3 and Theorem 6]{devito20}.
\end{proof}

This gives the key technical pillar upon which our calculations rest.
It both provides appropriate Hilbert spaces to use within the solution theory, and, by virtue of admitting reproducing kernels, guarantees that they are spaces of \emph{actual functions} $f : X \-> \R$ on the Riemannian manifold.
This enables us to plug pointwise evaluation functionals into the obtained generalized Gaussian field, yielding Riemannian Gaussian processes in the classical sense---the objects we sought to construct in the first place.

\parmarginnote{Riemannian squared exponential kernel}
Note that the operators $e^{\frac{s}{2}\lap_g}$ can be viewed as limits of appropriately rescaled versions of the operators $(1 - \lap_g)^{-s/2}$. 
Given that the Euclidean Mat√©rn kernel converges to the Euclidean squared exponential kernel as $\nu\->\infty$, we therefore view stochastic partial differential equations induced by $e^{\frac{s}{2}\lap_g}$ as giving rise to the \emph{Riemannian squared exponential kernel}---we make this perspective precise shortly.

To carry the necessary calculations out and compute the kernels of the Gaussian processes defined by our stochastic partial differential equations, we need to relate the Sobolev and diffusion spaces of \textcite{devito20} with the equations studied by \textcite{whittle63} and \textcite{lindgren11}.
To do so, we state and prove the main result.

\begin{theorem}[Riemannian Mat√©rn and squared exponential kernels]
For $\nu > 0$ and $\kappa > 0$, define the stochastic partial differential equations 
\[
\del{\frac{2\nu}{\kappa^2} - \lap_g}^{\frac{\nu}{2} + \frac{d}{4}} f &= \c{W}_g
&
e^{-\frac{\kappa^2}{4}\lap_g} f &= \c{W}_g
\]
where, respectively, we have
\[
\del{\frac{2\nu}{\kappa^2} - \lap_g}^{\frac{\nu}{2} + \frac{d}{4}} : H^{\nu + \frac{d}{2}}(X) \-> L^2(X)
\\
e^{-\frac{\kappa^2}{4}\lap_g} : \c{H}^{\frac{\kappa^2}{2}}(X) \-> L^2(X)
.
\]
Then, letting $(\lambda_n,f_n)$ be the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplace--Beltrami operator, in both cases the unique solutions $f$ are Gaussian processes with respective covariance kernels
\[
k(x, x') &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \del{\frac{2\nu}{\kappa^2} + \lambda_n}^{-\nu-\frac{d}{2}} f_n(x)f_n(x')
\\
k(x, x') &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty e^{-\frac{\kappa^2}{2} \lambda_n} f_n(x)f_n(x')
\]
which we call the \emph{Riemannian Mat√©rn} and \emph{Riemannian squared exponential} kernels.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Note first that the operators corresponding to the Mat√©rn kernel coincide with those used by \textcite{devito20} in defining the Sobolev spaces of interest if we have a fixed length scale given by $\kappa = \sqrt{2\nu}$.
Similarly, the operators corresponding to the squared exponential kernel always coincide.
In this setting, the reproducing kernels are given by \textcite[Proposition 2]{devito20} as
\[
k(x, x') &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \del{\frac{2\nu}{\kappa^2} + \lambda_n}^{-\nu-\frac{d}{2}} f_n(x)f_n(x')
\\
k(x, x') &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty e^{-\frac{\kappa^2}{2} \lambda_n} f_n(x)f_n(x')
\]
which proves the claim for the squared exponential case.
However, we are interested in general length scales $\kappa > 0$, so this does not suffice for the Mat√©rn case.
To extend this, the idea will be to let $\tilde{g} = \frac{2\nu}{\kappa}g$ be a rescaled metric tensor on $X$, and define 
\[
\del{\frac{2\nu}{\kappa^2} - \lap_g}^{\frac{\nu}{2} + \frac{d}{4}} f &= \c{W}_g
&
\del{1 - \lap_{\tilde{g}}}^{\frac{\nu}{2} + \frac{d}{4}} \tilde{f} &= \c{W}_{\tilde{g}}
\]
for which we would like to show that $f = \del{\frac{\kappa^2}{2\nu}}^{\frac{\nu}{2} + \frac{d}{2}} \tilde{f}$.
To begin, we first prove these operators are well-defined, by checking that they are bounded and invertible for all positive $\nu$ and $\kappa$.
By \Cref{res:riemannian-sobolev} we know that for every $f \in H^{\nu + \frac{d}{2}}(X)$, there is an $h \in L^2(X)$ such that $f = (1-\lap_g)^{-\frac{\nu}{2}-\frac{d}{4}} h$.
Moreover, both $f$ and $h$ can be expressed in the orthonormal basis given by Laplacian eigenfunctions $f_n$ as 
\[
h(x) &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \alpha_n f_n
&
f(x) &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \del{\frac{1}{1+\lambda_n}}^{\frac{\nu}{2}+\frac{d}{4}} \alpha_n f_n
\]
where the expression for $f$ follows by applying the operator $(1-\lap_g)^{-\frac{\nu}{2}-\frac{d}{4}}$ to the eigenfunctions.
Finally, note that since $\lambda_n \geq 0$ we have
\[
\min\del{\frac{2\nu}{\kappa^2}, 1} \leq \frac{\frac{2\nu}{\kappa^2} + \lambda_n}{1+\lambda_n} \leq \max\del{1, \frac{2\nu}{\kappa^2}}
.
\]
Using these identities, write
\[
\norm{\del{\frac{2\nu}{\kappa^2} - \lap_g}^{\frac{\nu}{2} + \frac{d}{4}} f}^2_{L^2(X)} &= \norm{\sum_{n=0}^\infty \del{\frac{\frac{2\nu}{\kappa^2} + \lambda_n}{1+\lambda_n}}^{\frac{\nu}{2}+\frac{d}{4}} \alpha_n f_n}^2_{L^2(X)}
\\
&\leq \sum_{n=0}^\infty \max\del{1, \frac{2\nu}{\kappa^2}} \alpha_n^2
\\
&= \max\del{1, \frac{2\nu}{\kappa^2}} \norm{f}^2_{H^{\nu + \frac{d}{2}}(X)}
\]
and similarly 
\[
\norm{\del{\frac{2\nu}{\kappa^2} - \lap_g}^{\frac{\nu}{2} + \frac{d}{4}} f}^2_{L^2(X)} &\geq \sum_{n=0}^\infty \min\del{\frac{2\nu}{\kappa^2},1} \alpha_n^2
\\
&= \min\del{\frac{2\nu}{\kappa^2},1} \norm{f}^2_{H^{\nu + \frac{d}{2}}(X)}  
\]
where we have also used orthonormality of $f_n$ as well as
\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \alpha_n^2 = \norm{h}^2_{L^2(X)} = \norm{f}^2_{H^{\nu + \frac{d}{2}}(X)}
\]
which follows from orthonormality of $f_n$ along with the definition of $h$ and \Cref{res:riemannian-sobolev}.
This proves boundedness and invertability.
To complete the argument, we check that the desired identity holds under a change of metric.
The change of metric expressions of interest are given by 
\[
\lap_{\tilde{g}} &= \frac{\kappa^2}{2\nu} \lap_g
&
\tilde{\lambda}_n &= 
&
\tilde{f}_n &= \del{\frac{2\nu}{\kappa^2}}^{-\frac{d}{4}} f_n
&
\vol_{\tilde{g}} &= \del{\frac{2\nu}{\kappa^2}}^{\frac{d}{2}} \vol_g
\]
thus starting from $(1 + \lap_{\tilde{g}})^{\frac{\nu}{2} + \frac{d}{4}} \tilde{f} = \c{W}_{\tilde{g}}$ we can write
\[
(1 + \lap_{\tilde{g}})^{\frac{\nu}{2} + \frac{d}{4}} = \del[3]{1 + \frac{\kappa^2}{2\nu} \lap_g}^{\frac{\nu}{2} + \frac{d}{4}} = \del[3]{\frac{\kappa^2}{2\nu}}^{\frac{\nu}{2} + \frac{d}{4}}  \del{\frac{2\nu}{\kappa^2} +  \lap_g}^{\frac{\nu}{2} + \frac{d}{4}} 
\]
as well as 
\[
\c{W}_{\tilde{g}} = \del{\frac{2\nu}{\kappa^2}}^{\frac{d}{4}} \c{W}_g
\]
which when combined gives $f = \del{\frac{\kappa^2}{2\nu}}^{\frac{\nu}{2} + \frac{d}{2}} \tilde{f}$.
On the other hand, under a change of metric, the series representation of the Mat√©rn kernel is
\[
\tilde{k}(x,x') &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty (1 + \tilde{\lambda}_n)^{-\nu - \frac{d}{2}} \tilde{f}_n(x) \tilde{f}_n(x')
\\
&= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \del[3]{1 + \frac{\kappa^2}{2\nu} \lambda_n}^{-\nu - \frac{d}{2}} \del{\frac{2\nu}{\kappa^2}}^{-\frac{d}{2}} f_n(x) f_n(x')
\\
&= \del[3]{\frac{\kappa^2}{2\nu}}^{-\nu - d} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \del{\frac{2\nu}{\kappa^2} + \lambda_n}^{-\nu - \frac{d}{2}} f_n(x) f_n(x')
\]
where $\tilde{k}$ is the transformed kernel, for which we see that $\del{\frac{\kappa^2}{2\nu}}^{\nu + d} \tilde{k}(x,x') = k(x,x')$.
But this exactly matches the covariance kernel of $f$ according to the given transformation of the Gaussian process, and the claim follows.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Illustrated examples}

Using the developed tools, we have defined Riemannian Gaussian processes of interest as solutions of stochastic partial differential equations, and derived expressions for their kernels which are explicit enough to be amenable to approximation. 
Here, we explore using these processes as priors in Bayesian learning.
Our goal is to understand how complicated geometry affects posterior uncertainty estimates.

We focus on the dragon manifold from the Stanford 3D scanning repository \cite{curless96}, approximated numerically as a mesh.
This mesh was chosen because it has no boundary and is geometrically more complex than other alternatives.
We work with the largest connected component of the mesh, which has a total of $100\,179$ vertices and $201\,010$ triangular faces.

On the mesh, discrete analogs of all of the differential-geometric notions we require are available, with reasonably well-understood approximation properties \cite{crane17}.
We obtain $500$ discretized Laplace--Beltrami eigenpairs numerically in finite element space using the \emph{Firedrake} partial differental equation package \cite{rathgeber16}.
These, in turn, gives expressions for evaluating the kernel and sampling the prior at any points on the manifold.

To generate training data, we define a group truth function given by the sine of the geodesic distance from a distinguished point, chosen to be the first vertex on the mesh, which is located at the end of the dragon's snout.
We observe this function at a total of $52$ points chosen from the mesh's vertices.
We train a Mat√©rn prior with smoothness $\nu = 3/2$ on this data using gradient descent, obtaining learned variance and length scale hyperparameters.
Finally, we obtain the posterior samples over the entire mesh using pathwise sampling.

\begin{figure}
\vspace*{10ex}

\vspace*{10ex}
\caption{A posterior Mat√©rn Gaussian process on the dragon manifold. We plot true function values, along with the posterior mean and standard deviations. Here, the black dots represent data. We observe that the standard deviation generally increases as we move away from the training locations.}
\label{fig:dr-posterior}
\end{figure}

Results are given in \Cref{fig:dr-posterior}.
We observe that the both the mean predictions and uncertainty estimates adapt to the manifold's geometry.
In particular, we see that uncertainty increases when moving away from the data.
We see that the two upper and lower parts of the dragon's snout have different uncertainty estimates, in spite of the fact that they are close in ambient Euclidean distance.
Overall, we conclude that the geometric Mat√©rn models used produce uncertainty estimates which reflect the manifold's geometry.

From the computational tools used, one can see that there is more to say about the developed model class.
In particular, the discrete analogs of the Laplace--Beltrami operator used within the finite element computations give rise to discrete Gaussian processes in their own right.
This leads one to ask: are there interesting analogs of Mat√©rn models in useful classes of discrete spaces?
We now proceed to develop one such analog.

\section{Graph Mat√©rn Gaussian Processes}

A general maxim of geometry is that anything one can do with a manifold, one can do with a graph, given a bit of thinking---but, the details and behavior might be slightly different.
In the preceding section, we built Gaussian processes using spectral properties of the Riemannian Laplace--Beltrami operator.
We now ask: can we repeat these constructions on graphs, obtaining Gaussian processes that can be used in very different settings?

\subsection{Review of graph theory}

\parmarginnote{Nodes, weights, edges}
A weighted undirected graph consists of a finite set of \emph{nodes}, each of which is assigned a positive real number called the \emph{weight}, and \emph{edges} between nodes.
Graphs with unit weights can be visualized by drawing a set of points on a two-dimensional plane or in three-dimensional space, representing the nodes, and drawing lines between the points, representing the edges.

\parmarginnote{Graphs and matrices}
A broad theme in graph theory is that geometric properties of graphs can be encoded as finite-dimensional vectors and matrices by picking an arbitrary ordering of nodes, and associate numerical properties to, say, with rows and columns of a matrix.
Define the \emph{weighted }\emphmarginnote{adjacency matrix} $\m{W}$ by letting the matrix entry corresponding to two nodes be their respective edge weight.
Similarly, define the diagonal \emphmarginnote{degree matrix} $\m{D}$ by $D_{ii} = \sum_j W_{ij}$---for graphs with unit weights, this counts how many neighbors each node has.

We can construct \emphmarginnote{functions on graphs}, which map each node into some space of interest, in a number of ways.
For defining functions which depend only on neighboring nodes, working with matrices induced by the graph is often useful.\marginnote{Permutation invariance and equivariance}
When doing so, we must take care that the functions constructed do not depend on the arbitrary choice of ordering used to associate nodes with matrix rows and columns. Algebraically, this is encoded through \emph{permutation invariance}, \emph{permutation equivariance}, and other similar requirements.


\parmarginnote{Discretizations of manifolds}
Graphs often arise as discretizations of manifolds: there are many ways of making this idea precise.
For example, one can consider an infinite sequence of nested finite subsets of the manifold converging monotonically to a countable dense subset thereof.
This defines a sequence of graphs by taking nodes to be the elements of each sets, and connecting neighboring edges.
Such sequences give rise to vector spaces of functions converging monotonically to an appropriate function space on the manifold.

\subsection{The graph Laplacian}

In the Riemannian setting, our strategy for building Gaussian process models essentially amounted to using functional calculus defined using spectral properties of the Laplace--Beltrami operator to construct the Gaussian processes of interest as solutions of stochastic partial differential equations.
This strategy depended on the manifold only through the Laplace--Beltrami operator, and the white noise process, which suggests that it may also work for other classes of spaces.

Weighted directed graphs in particular admit the notion of a \emphmarginnote{graph Laplacian}, which is a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix defined as 
\[
\m\lap = \m{D} - \m{W}
\]
where $\m{D}$ is the degree matrix and $\m{W}$ is the weighted adjacency matrix.
The graph Laplacian can be interpreted as a linear operator acting the space of all functions $f : G \-> \R$ where $G$ is the set of nodes.
Each such function can be represented as a $|G|$-dimensional vector $\v{f}$ by assigning an ordering to the nodes, as described previously.
From this viewpoint, the graph Laplacian is
\[
(\m\lap\v{f})(x) = \sum_{x'\~x} f(x) - f(x')
\]
where $x$ is a node, and sum is taken over all neighboring nodes $x'$ of $x$.
This expression now resembles its Euclidean and Riemannian analogs in a much more direct manner, and justifies why one would call $\m\lap$ a Laplacian in the first place.
First, though, we clarify the choice of sign in this expression.

\begin{remark}[Sign convention]
Following standard practice in graph theory, we adopt a \emph{different sign convention} for the graph Laplacian compared to its Euclidean and Riemannian analogs.
One should thus view the operators 
\[
&\ubr{\phantom{-}\m\lap}_{\t{no minus sign}}
&
&\ubr{-\lap}_{\t{minus sign}}
\]
as analogues of one-another---in particular, both are positive semi-definite.
\emph{Note the different minus signs!}
This corresponds to adopting the analyst's rather than geometer's convention for studying $\lap$.
\end{remark}

In the graph case, we can also develop a notion of \emphmarginnote{functional calculus} just as we developed previously.
This time, however, doing so is mathematically more-or-less trivial: for a function $\Phi : \R \-> \R$ and a diagonal matrix $\m\Lambda$, let $\Phi(\m\Lambda)$ be the matrix obtained by applying $\Phi$ to the diagonal.
Then, letting $\m\lap = \m{U}\m\Lambda\m{U}^T$ be the eigenvalue decompositin of $\m\lap$, which by positive semi-definiteness always exists, define
\[
\Phi(\m\lap) = \m{U}\Phi(\m\Lambda)\m{U}^T
.
\]
This gives a notion of functional calculus analogous to the one considered previously in the Riemannian case, only without the need to introduce any mathematical theory beyond elementary eigenvalue factorizations.
In particular, since all matrices are finite, we do not need to consider any kind of convergence.
We now examine Gaussian processes from this perspective.

\subsection{The graph Mat√©rn kernel}

Our goal now is to construct Gaussian processes $f : G \-> \R$ where $G$ is the set of nodes of a weighted undirected graph.
We'd like to define processes whose covariance reflects the structure of the graph.
To do this, we adapt the notions of Mat√©rn and squared exponential Gaussian processes studied previously to the graph setting.

Recall that in the Euclidean and Riemannian cases, these processes were defined as solutions of stochastic partial differential equations with left-hand-sides defined using functional calculus, and right-hand-sides consisting of white noise processes.
Adapting this definition by replacing $-\lap$ with $\m\lap$ and dropping dimension-dependent terms from exponents gives 
\[
\del{\frac{2 \nu}{\kappa^2} + \m\Delta}^\frac{\nu}{2} \v{f}(\omega) &= \bc{W}(\omega)
&
e^{\frac{\kappa^2}{4} \m\Delta} \v{f}(\omega) &= \bc{W}(\omega)
\]
where $\bc{W} \~[N](\v{0},\m{I})$ are standard Gaussians, and $\v{f} : \Omega \-> \R^{|G|}$ are the random vectors defining the stochastic processes $f : \Omega \x G \-> \R$ defined on the graph's nodes.
Note that the numbers $\frac{2 \nu}{\kappa^2}$ are \emph{not} added element-wise to the graph Laplacian---instead, following the established conventions, they are added to its \emph{eigenvalues}.
By elementary algebra, the \emphmarginnote{graph Mat√©rn Gaussian processes} and \emph{graph squared exponential Gaussian processes} are given by
\[
\v{f} &\~[N]\del{\v{0}, \del{{\textstyle\frac{2 \nu}{\kappa^2}} + \m\Delta}^{-\nu}}
&
\v{f} &\~[N]\del{\v{0}, e^{-\frac{\kappa^2}{2} \m\Delta}}
\]
This defines the graph Mat√©rn and squared Gaussian processes of interest.
We now explore some of their properties.


By virtue of its definition, $\m\lap$ inherits \emphmarginnote{sparsity} properties from graphs.
Thus, for sufficiently small integers $\nu$ and many graphs, the matrices $(\frac{2 \nu}{\kappa^2} + \m\Delta)^{\frac{\nu}{2}}$ will be sparse.
If the precise sparsity pattern is sufficiently well-behaved---for instance in certain planar graphs---these matrices' Cholesky factors will also be sparse, potentially reducing computational costs from cubic to linear or close to it.
Alternatively, Krylov subspace methods for sparse linear systems can be applied, giving another way to leverage sparsity to improve scalability.

\label{fig:graph-variance}
\end{figure}

Graph Mat√©rn and graph squared exponential kernels possess \emphmarginnote{non-uniform variance}, whose precise form will vary with the graph.
In particular, each node's variance is not simply a function of its degree, and instead depends on the precise geometry in a complex manner.
This can be seen in \Cref{fig:graph-variance}.
Similar phenomena occur in random walk kernels studied by \textcite{urry13}---in that setting, variance is determined by the return time of a certain random walk defined on the graph.

It's also possible to use the \emphmarginnote{Symmetric normalized graph Laplacian}, which is defined as $\m{D}^{-1/2}\m\lap\m{D}^{-1/2}$, to define analogous to the ones above, by using this matrix in place of the graph Laplacian.
This yields the \emph{symmetric normalized graph Mat√©rn} and \emph{symmetric normalized graph sqaured exponential} Gaussian processes.
These can be preferrable in domains where symmetric normalized Laplacians are customarily used.

\parmarginnote{Connection with random walks}
The graph squared exponential kernel can be connected with \emph{random walks} in a number of ways.
Firstly, it is the Green's function of the graph diffusion equation.
More precisely, if $\v\phi : [0,\infty) \x G \-> \R$ solves the equation 
\[
\v{\dot\phi}_t + \m\lap\v\phi_t &= 0
&
\v\phi_0 &= \v{v}
\]
then $\v\phi(\tau,\.) = e^{-\tau\m\lap}\v{v}$, where our notation again uses the equivalence between vectors and real-valued functions on $G$.
This equation has a strong physical interpretation: it describes heat transfer along the graph---this gives a way to understand what kind of prior information graph squred exponential kernel introduces.
Similarly, if $\m\lap$ is replaced with the symmetric normalized graph Laplacian, then $\v\phi(\tau,\.)$ can be interpreted as the unnormalized probability density of a continuous-time random walk moving along the graph.

Another way to understand the prior information contained in the given kernels is through limits.
Mirroring all other settings considered, graph Mat√©rn kernels converge to graph squared exponential kernels as $\nu\->\infty$.
This is essentially immediate, since their eigenvectors coincide, and eigenvalues converge.
Graph squared exponential kernels also arise as a limit of the \emph{random walk kernel} of \textcite{smola03}, which is defined as
\[
(\m{I} - (1-\alpha)\m{D}^{-1/2}\m\lap\m{D}^{-1/2})^k
.
\]
This kernel arises from symmetrizing the $k$-step transition matrix of a certain lazy random walk on a graph.
Though it looks similar to the graph Mat√©rn kernel, its structure is very different: $k > 0$ is positive rather than negative, $\alpha\in[0,1)$ is interpreted as the laziness parameter of the underlying random walk, and the Laplacian is subtracted rather than added.
Still, this kernel converges to the graph squared exponential kernel: if we set $\alpha = 1 - \frac{\kappa^2}{2k}$ with $\kappa$ a fixed constant, we have 
\[
\lim_{k\->\infty} (\m{I} - (1-\alpha)\m{D}^{-1/2}\m\lap\m{D}^{-1/2})^k = e^{-\frac{\kappa^2}{2} \m{D}^{-1/2}\m\lap\m{D}^{-1/2}}
.
\]
This provides another view of the connection between the graph squared exponential kernel and random walk models.

Finally, the introduced graph kernels also converge to \emphmarginnote{Riemannian limits}, provided these are understood appropriately.
One way to formalize this is to embed the graph within a Euclidean space, and study vector spaces of piecewise-linear functions between neighboring nodes.
Sequences of such graphs arise as \emph{finite element} discretizations of function spaces, which were considered previously in \Cref{ch:pathwise}.
Here, \textcite{lindgren11} show that certain graph Mat√©rn Gaussian processes converge to their Riemannian limits.

For graph Mat√©rn kernels that do not arise in this manner, a number of other formulations are available.
One can show that for appropriately defined and sufficiently regular sequences of graphs, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian converge to the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplace--Beltrami operator \cite{belkin07,burago14}.
Using this, \textcite{sanzalonso20} provide a framework for studying limits of graph Mat√©rn kernels.

In total, these results illustrate that graph Mat√©rn and graph squared exponential kernels are closely-connected with their Riemannian analogs, which justifies both the names they are given, and the choice of defining them using the graph Laplacian in the first place.
In spite of their similarity, however, these models can be used in settings which are very different from the manifold setting that inspired them.
We now illustrate a few possibilities.

\subsection{Illustrated examples}

To illustrate the graph Mat√©rn Gaussian processes, we demonstrate their use in a setting which departs considerably from the Euclidean and Riemannian settings considered previously.
Our goal is to show how such models may enable applications that are very different from those in which Gaussian processes have been traditionally used.

Specifically, we consider probabilistic interpolation of traffic data along a road network consisting of highways in the city of San Jose, California, obtained from OpenStreetMap \cite{osm17}.
In this graph, nodes are traffic sensors, and edges are roads between sensors, one for each side of the street.
Edges are weighted by inverse distance.
We work with the largest connected component of the graph, which has $1016$ nodes and $1173$ edges.

For trainign data, we examine traffic flow speed, which is available at $325$ nodes, using $250$ randomly chosen nodes for the training set and the remainder as the test set.
To simplify the problem and aid visualization, we focus on a single time slice consisting of traffic on Monday at 5:30pm, and do not consider space-time behavior.
We compute the kernel approximately using $500$ Laplace--Beltrami eigenpairs, and train the model by optimizing kernel hyperparameters and likelihood error variance.

\caption{View of a zoomed-in portion of the posterior means and standard deviations of the probabilistic graph interpolation task on the road network. Note the small-scale variation present within the error bars.}
\end{figure}



Results can be seen in \Cref{fig:graph-posterior}.
Here, we see that in spite of the heavily non-manifold-like geometry present in this graph, the Gaussian process still reflects the graph's geometric structure.
In particular, the width of the error bars given by the posterior standard deviation increases as we move away from nodes where there is data.
We conclude that, like in the manifold case, the Gaussian process produces uncertainty estimates which reflect the graph's structure given by the connectivity of nodes.

While this example is not particularly realistic, since we have not considered temporal interpolation nor other effects likely to be important in accurate modeling of traffic, it nonetheless illustrates that modeling heavily non-Euclidean data using Gaussian processes is possible.
We hope these illustrations prompt others to imagine new and unexpected use cases for Gaussian processes.
We thus end our detour and return to the manifold setting.

\section{Gaussian Vector Fields on Riemannian Manifolds}

In the preceding sections, we studied Gaussian processes in two different non-Euclidean settings, namely those of graphs and manifolds.
In both cases, the models obtained were scalar-valued.
We now ask: can we use these models to define vector-valued Gaussian processes on manifolds?
The first step, then, is to understand what such a notion ougth to actually mean.

\subsection{Vector fields on manifolds}

A \emph{vector field} $f$ on a smooth manifold $X$ is defined as a section of the tangent bundle---we recall that this is a function $f : X \-> TX$ such that $\proj_X \after f = \id_X$.
This requirement is very intuitive: it says that for any point $x$, the tangent vector $v_x = f(x)$ must be attached to $x$.
Vector fields on manifolds exhibit certain mathematical behaviors not present in the Euclidean case---we illustrate one of the most important kinds below.

\begin{result}[Hairy Ball Theorem]
There does not exist a nowhere-vanishing smooth section on any even-dimensional sphere whose dimension is at least two.
\end{result}

\begin{proof}
\textcite[Theorem 13.32]{lee10}.
\end{proof}

This result is called the \emph{hairy ball} theorem due to its interpretation: namely, it tell us in particular that if consider a two-dimensional sphere with hair on its surface, then it is not possible to comb the hair without creating a swirl or other location where the direction of the hair changes abruptly.

This result restricts the kind of technical tools available for studying vector fields on manifolds.
In particular, it implies that for a generic smooth manifold, it is not possible to choose a smoothly-varying set of basis vectors in each tangent space simultaneously.
Because of this, it also follows that a smooth section $f : X \-> TX$ \emph{cannot} be reinterpreted a continuous function $f : X \-> \R^d$ in general.
This makes understanding vector fields a more delicate endeavour for manifolds compared to Euclidean spaces.

We are interested in defining vector-valued Gaussian processes on manifolds.
The first question that arises, then, is what should one actually mean when describing a random function $f : \Omega \x X \-> TX$ as \emph{Gaussian}?
The preceding sections suggest two possible approaches.

\1 Adapt the notion of \emph{Gaussian finite-dimensional marginal distributions} to the tangent bundle setting.
\2 Introduce an appropriate infinite-dimensional \emph{vector space of sections} and work with Gaussians in the sense of duality.
\0 

Clearly, the latter approach is more elegant and more general, but it is also also more effortful and potentially less constructive.
Since we are ultimately interested in working with Gaussian vector fields algorithmically, we adopt the former approach, but keep the latter view in mind to ensure soundness of our overall strategy.
We proceed as follows.

\begin{figure}
\vspace*{10ex}
[Frame 3D Visual]
\vspace*{10ex}
\caption{A vector field can be represented by specifying its values in any frame. Here, we illustrate the same vector field on the sphere represented using two different frames.}
\end{figure}

\begin{definition}[Gaussian vector field]
Let $X$ be a smooth manifold.
We say that a random section $f : \Omega \x X \-> TX$ is \emph{Gaussian} if for any finite set of locations $x_1, \ldots, x_n \in X$, the random vector $(f(\.,x_1),\ldots,f(\.,x_n)) \in T_{x_1}X \oplus \ldots \oplus T_{x_n}X$ is Gaussian in the sense of duality.
\end{definition}

Thus, we see that in spite of the fact that a tangent bundle is a manifold, and not a vector space, it possesses enough linear structure to admit a sensible notion of finite-dimensional marginals.
Here, we immediately see the value of the duality-based approach to Gaussianity originally developed in \Cref{ch:intro}: by using this, rather than working with bases, we avoid the need for cumbersome change-of-basis consistency checks.
We now examine this notion's view from the vantage point of an embedding into Euclidean space.

\begin{proposition}
Let $i : X \-> \R^p$ be a smooth embedding. Then 
\[
f_i : \Omega \x i(X) &\-> \R^p
&
f_i(\omega,x) &= i_* f(\omega, i^{-1}(x))&
\]
is a vector-valued Gaussian process in the standard sense.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Since the embedding $i$ is bijective on its image, any set of locations $x_1^{(i)},..,x_n^{(i)} \in i(X)$, will map uniquely onto a set of locations $x_1,..,x_n \in X$.
By definition of vector pushforward maps, $i_*$ maps tangent vectors from $T_{x_1} X \oplus .. \oplus T_{x_n} X$ into $\R^{n\times p}$ linearly.
Since Gaussianity is preserved by linearity, every set of finite-dimensional marginals in the embedded process is Gaussian, and the claim follows.
\end{proof}

This confirms that out definition of a vector-valued Gaussian process is the right one: if we embed the manifold in a Euclidean space, we obtain the correct kind of stochastic process.

As before, the mean of such a process will simply be a given vector field.
The next step is to determine what is an appropriate notion of a \emph{kernel}.
In the Euclidean case, a \emphmarginnote{matrix-valued kernel} is a symmetric positive semi-definite function $k : X \x X \-> \R^{d \x d}$.
This notion more-or-less completely analogous to the scalar-valued case.
A priori, this notion seems completely coordinate-dependent due to the matrix appearing in the output.
To avoid this, we instead consider the map
\[
((x,\v{v}), (x',\v{v}')) \|> \v{v}^T \m{K}_{xx'} \v{v}'
\]
which describes the action of the kernel matrix on vectors.
To continue, we need an appropriate notion of bilinearity for the given setting.

\begin{definition}[Fiberwise bilinear function]
Let $B$ be a vector bundle over $X$ with fibers $V_x$, $x\in X$.
We say that a function $k : B \x B \-> \R$ \emph{fiberwise bilinear} if for all pairs of points $x, x' \in X$ we have that
\[
k(\kappa \alpha_x + \lambda \beta_x, \gamma_{x'}) &= \kappa k(\alpha_x, \gamma_{x'}) + \lambda k(\beta_x, \gamma_{x'})
\\
k(\alpha_x, \mu \gamma_{x'} + \nu \delta_{x'}) &= \mu k(\alpha_x, \gamma_{x'}) + \nu k(\alpha_x, \delta_{x'})
\]
for any $\alpha_x, \beta_x \in V_x$, $\gamma_{x'}, \delta_{x'} \in V_{x'}$ and $\kappa, \lambda, \mu, \nu \in \R$.
\end{definition}

This leads to the following notion of a kernel.

\begin{definition}[Positive semi-definite kernel]
A symmetric fiberwise bilinear function $k : T^* X \x T^* X \-> \R$ is called \emph{positive semi-definite kernel} if for any set of covectors $\alpha_{x_1}, \ldots, \alpha_{x_n} \in T^*X$, we have 
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n k(\alpha_{x_i}, \alpha_{x_j}) \geq 0
.
\]
\end{definition}

At first, this may seem surprising: why should the kernel be a function defined on the \emph{cotangent} bundle, rather than the tangent bundle?
A clue is given by the form of the multivariate Gaussian density, which contains a $\v{x}^T\m{K}_{\v{x}\v{x}}^{-1}\v{x}$ term---note the presence of the inverse.
This suggests that since the inverse kernel matrix acts on vectors, the kernel matrix should act on covectors.
This is clarified further by considering the kernel of a given Gaussian vector field.

\begin{definition}[Cross-covariance kernel]
The \emph{cross-covariance kernel} of a Gaussian vector field is defined as the map
\[
\alpha_x, \beta_{x'} \|> \Cov(\dualprod{\alpha_x}{f(\.,x)}, \dualprod{\beta_{x'}}{f(\.,x')}).
\]
\end{definition}

We now verify that this is indeed the correct notion of a kernel for the given setting.
To do this, we need a general form of the Kolmogorov Extension Theorem, given by the following result.

\begin{result}[Kolmogorov Extension Theorem]
Let $(X_\alpha,\c{B}_\alpha,\c{O}_\alpha)_{\alpha\in A}$ be a family of measurable spaces, each equipped with a topology.
For each finite $B \subseteq A$, let $\mu_B$ be an inner regular probability measure on $X_B = \prod_{\alpha\in B} X_\alpha$ with $\sigma$-algebra $\c{B}_B$ and with the product topology $\c{O}_B$ obeying
\[\label{project-measure}
\del{\proj_C}_* \mu_B = \mu_C
\]
whenever $C \subseteq B \subseteq A$ are two nested finite subsets of $A$. 
Here, projections $\proj_C: X_B \-> X_C$ are defined by $\proj_C(\cbr{x_\alpha}_{\alpha \in B}) = \cbr{x_\alpha}_{\alpha \in C}$ and $\del{\proj_C}_*$ denotes the pushforward by $\proj_{C}$.
Then there exists a unique probability measure $\mu_A$ on $\c{B}_A$ with the property that $\del{\proj_B}_* \mu_A = \mu_B$ for all finite $B \subseteq A$.
\end{result}

\begin{proof}
\textcite[Theorem 2.4.3]{tao11}.
\end{proof}

We are now ready to prove our bijective correspondence.

\begin{theorem}
The distribution of every Gaussian vector field is uniquely determined by its mean vector field and cross-covariance kernel.
Moreover, each such pair defines a Gaussian vector field.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $x_1,..,x_n \in X$ and for $\alpha = (\alpha_{x_1},..,\alpha_{x_n})$ and $\beta = (\beta_{x_1},..,\beta_{x_n})$ define 
\[
\mu_{x_1,..,x_n} &= (\mu(x_1),..,\mu(x_n))
&
k_{x_1,..,x_n}(\alpha, \beta) &= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n k(\alpha_{x_i}, \beta_{x_j})
.
\]
Let $\pi_{x_1,..,x_n} \~[N](\mu_{x_1,..,x_n}, k_{x_1,..,x_n})$ be defined in the sense of duality.
These are our finite-dimensional marginals: by Gaussianity, it is clear these are uniquely determined by the mean and kernel.
Taking $X$ to be the index set, and $(T_x X)_{x\in X}$ with standard topology and Borel $\sigma$-algebra to be our measurable spaces, we claim that the family of measures $(\pi_{x_1,..,x_n})_{\{x_1,..,x_n\} \subseteq X}$ satisfies the requirements of Kolmogorov's Extension Theorem.
First, for any $\{x_1,..,x_n\} \subseteq \{x_1,..,x_n\}$, by direct calculation we have 
\[
(\proj_{x_1,..,x_m})_* \pi_{x_1,..,x_n} = \pi_{x_1,..,x_m}
\]
using the canonical projection induced by the direct sum.
Next, note that each $\pi_{x_1,..,x_n}$ is a probability measure on a finite-dimensional real space, it is automatically inner regular.
Thus, it follows that there exists a unique measure on the infinite product space $\prod_{x\in X} T_x X$.
This is a topological measure space: if we equip it with the obvious linear structure, and define the linear operator 
\[
\c{I} : \prod_{x\in X} T_x X &\-> \Gamma_{\f{ns}}(TX)
&
(\c{I}s)(x) &= (x, \proj_x s)
\]
where $\Gamma_{\f{alg}}(TX)$ is the space of not necessarily smooth sections, equipped with the pushforward $\sigma$-algebra, we obtain by pushforward the probability distribution of our desired process.
The claim follows.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Coordinate representations and gauge equivariance}

Using the preceding recipe, we now understand what needs to be defined in order to construct a vector-valued Gaussian processes on manifolds. 
To make this construction concrete, we proceed to develop the calculations needed to implement such processes numerically.
The first step is to understand how to represent vector fields in coordinates---we do so using bases in each tangent space.

\begin{definition}[Frame]
Define a \emph{frame} $F$ to be a collection of not necessarily smooth sections $e_i : X \-> TX$ for $i=1,..,d$ such that, for every $x \in X$, the vectors $e_i(x)$ form a basis of $T_x X$.
Given a frame, define the \emph{coframe} $F^*$ to be the collection of sections $e^i : X \-> T^* X$ defined pointwise using the dual basis with respect to $F$.
\end{definition}

The key words in the above definition are \emph{not necessarily smooth}: recall again that for many manifolds, choosing a frame which varies smoothly in space is impossible---a single component of such a frame would yield a non-vanishing vector field, and such a vector field might not exist.
We can use this to calculate the coordinate expression of a cross-covariance kernel with respect to a frame.
This is given by a function $\m{K}_F : X \x X \-> \R^{d \x d}$ as
\[
\m{K}_F(x,x') = \begin{bmatrix} \label{eq:K_F}
k(e^1(x), e^1(x')) & \dots  & k(e^1(x), e^d(x')) \\
\vdots           & \ddots & \vdots \\
k(e^d(x), e^1(x')) & \dots  & k(e^d(x), e^d(x'))
\end{bmatrix}
\]
which is a matrix-valued kernel in the usual sense.
This expression is frame-dependent: to see how it transforms upon a change of frame, introduce a frame $\tl{F}$, and consider a function
\[
f(x) &= \sum_{i=1}^d f^i(x) e_i(x) = \sum_{i=1}^d \tl{f}^i(x) \tl{e}_i(x)
\]
expressed with respect to $F$ and $\tl{F}$, where $\tl{f}^i$ and $g^i$ are scalar-valued functions.
We say that $\tl{F}$ is obtained from $F$ by a \emphmarginnote{gauge transformation} if there is a matrix-valued function $\m{A} : X \-> \R^{d \x d}$ such that 
\[
\v{\tilde{f}}(x) = \m{A}(x) \v{f}(x)
\]
for all $x$.
Since $e_i$ and $\tl{e}_i$ are bases, such a function always exists.
By direct calculation, $\m{K}_F$ can be re-expressed as 
\[
\m{K}_{\tl{F}}(x,x') = \m{A}(x)\m{K}_F(x,x')\m{A}(x)^T
\]
with respect to $\tl{F}$.
This condition is called \emphmarginnote{gauge equivariance}.
At this point, it is clear why we did not even attempt to generalize matrix-valued kernels directly by guessing the required formulas: for an arbirary manifold, there is very little hope of guessing an expression that is positive semi-definite and gauge-equivariant simultaneously.

\subsection{Projected kernels}

Now that we understand how to write kernels of Gaussian vector fields in coordinates, we are ready to consider techniques for constructnig such kernels and calculating them numerically. 
With our preparation complete, the construction we present is extremely simple, consiting of two steps.
\1 Embed a set of $p$ scalar-valued Riemannian Gaussian processes from $X$ into $i(X) \subseteq \R^p$, and use them to assemble a vector-valued Gaussian process defined on on $i(X)$.
\2 Project the tangent vectors onto each tangent space, obtaining a tangential vector field in the embedded space, and therefore a vector field on $X$.
\0 
We now proceed to make this precisel.
Suppose that we have an embedding
\[
i : X &\-> \R^p
&
i_{x,*} : T_x X &\-> \R^p
\]
where the pushforward is defined at all points $x\in X$.
Introducing a frame $F$ allows us to define the projection map, which is a matrix-valued function $\m{P} : X \-> \R^{p \x d}$ defined by
\[
\m{P}(x) =\begin{bmatrix}
i_{x,*}(e_i(x)) \\
\vdots \\ 
i_{x,*}(e_d(x))
\end{bmatrix} 
\]
which describes how to project arbitrary vectors onto tangent planes.
Note that the linear map given by this matrix is a right-inverse to the map given by $\m{P}^T$, which describes how a vector field with respect to a frame can be re-expressed with respect to the coordinates in the embedded space.
In particular, if $X$ is Riemannian with metric $g$, we have $\m{P}^T \m{P} = \m\Gamma$, where $\Gamma_{ij} = g(e_i(x_i), e_j(x))$, giving the coordinate representation of the identity map with respect to the metric.
It is now clear how to make our idea precise.

\begin{figure}
\vspace*{10ex}
[Projected Kernel 3D Visual]
\vspace*{10ex}
\caption{Here, we show how to construct Gaussian process on the sphere whose cross-covariance kernel is a projected kernel. First, we construct three scalar Gaussian processes on the sphere. Then, embed the sphere in $\R^3$, and the scalar Gaussian processes to form a vector-valued Gaussian process on the embedded sphere. Finally, we project the resulting Gaussian process onto the sphere, yielding the desired tangential vector field.}
\end{figure}

\begin{definition}[Projected kernel]
Let $\v{f} : \Omega \x X \-> \R^{p\x p}$ be a Gaussian process defined on $i(X) \subseteq \R^p$, and define the Gaussian vector field
\[
f(\omega, x) = \m{P}(x) \v{f}(\omega, i(x))
.
\]
We call the cross-covariance kernel of a process constructed this way a \emph{projected kernel}.
\end{definition}

It that if $\v\kappa : X \x X \-> \R^{p \x p}$ is the cross-covariance kernel of $\v{f}$, then the cross-covariance kernel of our Gaussian vector field is given by 
\[
\m{K}_F(x,x') = \m{P}(x) \v\kappa(x,x') \m{P}(x)^T
.    
\]
Note that here, we generally require a Riemannian structure on $X$ in order to define a useful set of scalar-valued processes in order to obtain $\v{f}$ or, equivalently, $\v\kappa$, to begin with.
The simplest approach is to make each component in the embedded space independent.
Particularly in cases where the embedding is isometric, this gives a wide class of easy-to-understand kernels.

It's easy to see that all cross-covariance kernels arise this way: using Nash's Theorem, we can embed an arbitrary Gaussian vector field on a Riemannian manifold into a Euclidean space, glue together the resulting scalar components, and project back to obtain the Gaussian vector field we started with.

This completes our technical development. 
Starting from first principles, we defined the notion of a Gaussian vector field, described in what sense such processes possess mean vectors and cross-covariance kernels, and defined a wide-ranging class of kernels which is completely constructive and can be implemented in software.
In particular, our constructions are automatically compatible with standard training methods such as variational inference.

\subsection{Illustrated examples}

\caption{Posterior mean and trace of posterior covariance for a projected Gaussian vector field constructed using three independent Mat√©rn-3/2 Gaussian processes on the sphere. Training locations are shown in white. We observe that uncertainty increases as we movea way from the training locations.}
\label{fig:posterior-vector-field}
\end{figure}

We now explore training Gaussian vector fields on Riemannian manifolds on observed data. 
Our goal is to demonstrate that the developed techniques are, in total, sufficiently explicit so as to enable Gaussian vector fields to be trained using standard methods without the need for any additional machinery.

We work with the sphere.
For training data, we consider interpolations of wind velocity data.
Specifically, we consider interpolation of wind velocity deviations from historical average, at a fixed height, using wind velocity data directly observed by a satellite.
For the prior, we use a Gaussian vector field model constructed using a projected kernel whose components are independent Mat√©rn-3/2 scalar-valued Gaussian processes on the sphere.

We train the Gaussian process using exactly the same procedure as that used in the preceding sections: by optimizing kernel hyperparameters using gradient descent, and computing the value of the vector field at all locations using pathwise sampling.
All computations are performed in a with respect to a fixed frame defined by the latitude-longitude coordinate system.

Results can be seen in \Cref{fig:posterior-vector-field}.
We observe that for the vector field shown, posterior uncertainty increases as we move away from locations where training data is available.
We also observe that the trained Gaussian process model is smooth, even though the choice of frame is non-smooth at the top of the sphere---one of our key motivations behind developing the theory for working with vector fields in a geometrically-sound way in the first place.

While the model used here is, as in the preceding section, not at all realistic owing to the fact that it does not incorporate time or any kind of physical information into its design, we believe that it nonetheless serves as a demonstration that constructing vector-valued Gaussian processes using the ideas developed is practical.
We hope this motivates further development to apply such models more broadly, both for the sphere and for other manifolds.

\section{Geometry-aware Bayesian Optimization}

We now study the role that geometry plays when working with decision systems built using Gaussian processes.
To do so, we perform Bayesian optimization of standard benchmark functions on Riemannian manifolds using the Riemannian Mat√©rn and squared exponential Gaussian processes with the numerical techniques developed herein.
Following \textcite{jaquier20}, we call this setting \emph{geometry-aware Bayesian optimization}.

We work with three manifolds, namely the spheres $\bb{S}^3$ and $\bb{S}^5$, and the special orthogonal group $SO(3)$.
We view each of these as embedded within a $d'$-dimensional Euclidean space in the natural manner.
We use three target functions commonly used as benchmark functions for global optimization, namely the \emph{Ackley} \cite{ackley87}, \emph{Rosenbrock} \cite{rosenbrock60}, and \emph{Styblinski--Tang} \cite{styblinski90} functions.
In the ambient Euclidean space, these are defined as 
\[
f_{\f{A}}(x_1,..,x_{d'}) &= -20\exp\del{-0.2\sqrt{\frac{1}{d'} \sum_{i=1}^d x_i^2}} 
\\
&\qquad - \exp\del{\frac{1}{d'} \sum_{i=1}^{d'} \cos(2\pi x_i)} + 20 + e
\\
f_{\f{R}}(x_1,..,x_{d'}) &= \sum_{i=1}^{d'-1} 100(x_{i+1} - x_i^2)^2 + (x_i - 1)^2
\\
f_{\f{ST}}(x_1,..,x_{d'}) &= \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{d'} (x_i^4 - 16x_i^2 + 5x_i)
\]
where $-32 \leq x_i \leq 32$ for $f_{\f{A}}$, $-5 \leq x_i \leq 10$ for $f_{\f{R}}$, and $-5 \leq x_i \leq 5$ for $f_{\f{ST}}$.
The target function we seek to optimize is the restriction of each of these functions onto the desired manifold.

\begin{figure*}[p!]
\vspace*{40ex}

\vspace*{40ex}
\caption{Geometry-aware Bayesian optimization comparison.}
\label{fig:gabo}
\end{figure*}


For each manifold, we use two priors: Mat√©rn with smoothness $\nu = 5/2$ and squared exponential, as well as a Gaussian likelihood.
The remaining kernel hyperparameters and likelihood error variance are learned from observed data via gradient descent.
We run for a total of $n=256$ iterations, and repeat each experiment $32$ times to assess variability.

For the acquisition function, we use expected improvement, which was previously defined in \Cref{sec:bayesian-optimization}.
Since this acquisition function can be computed from the Gaussian process directly, we work only with the kernel and do not rely on pathwise sampling.


Results can be seen in \Cref{fig:gabo}.
TODO: interpret.

For manifolds embedded within Euclidean space, geometry-aware Bayesian optimization can be viewed as a form of Bayesian optimization with enforced constraints that require evaluations to lie on the embedded submanifold.
Techniques such as the ones we have developed are therefore a promising tool for introducing geometric constraints into Bayesian optimization, potentially enabling new applications.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:noneuclidean-discussion}

In the preceding section, we have developed three key classes of \emph{non-Euclidean Gaussian process} models: the \emph{Riemannian Mat√©rn} and \emph{graph Mat√©rn} classes of scalar-valued Gaussian processes, and the \emph{projected kernel} class of vector-valued Gaussian processes on Riemannian manifolds.
Each of these provides a unifying view of previously-proposed methods, and expands Gaussian processes models' scope of applicability.

The key idea for defining Mat√©rn Gaussian processes on Riemannian manifolds was to not attempt to define kernels using geodesic distances---such constructions, while intuitively appealing, turn out to not lead to an effective mathematical formalism.
Instead, we relied on the idea of \emph{functional calculus} built using spectral theory of the Laplace--Beltrami operator to introduce operators through which we constructed the desired Gaussian processes as transformations of Gaussian white noise processes.

Adopting this viewpoint enabled us to reinterpret models previously-proposed within a cumbersome finite element framework using a more abstract approach built via the theory of stochastic partial differential equations and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.
From this approach, we obtained formulas for pointwise evaluation of the \emph{Riemannian Mat√©rn kernel} in terms of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplace--Beltrami operator.
The formalism also enabled us to define and compute the \emph{Riemannian squared exponential kernel}.

While our original original formalism was introduced for working with manifolds, it is clear that the constructions are more general.
Inspired by the discrete computations used in implementing the Riemannian Gaussian processes we defined, we explored purely-discrete analogs of these models, obtaining the \emph{graph Mat√©rn kernel} and \emph{graph squared exponential kernel}.
These enabled us to apply Mat√©rn Gaussian processes to model phenomena in purely discrete spaces whose geometry departs significantly from classical settings.

Finally, we returned to the manifold setting, this time studying formalism for defining \emph{Gaussian vector fields}.
This setting is non-trivial from the point of conceptualization: a vector-valued Gaussian is only \emph{locally} a vector-valued random function, and instead should be formulated using the differential-geometric formalism of \emph{random sections}.
We therefore began by clarifying what the appropriate notion of a \emph{cross-covarince kernel} should be, and how to work with this notion numerically.

Having clarified what a the notion of a \emph{Gaussian vector field} ought to be, we introduced a wide class of cross-covarince kernels for defining such processes called \emph{projected kernels}.
These kernels can be built from the Riemannian Gaussian process models already defined, together with an embedding of the manifold into an ambient Euclidean space, and produce covariances that reflect the manifold's geometry.
This construction enabled us to implement Bayesian learning of vector-valued data on the sphere.

Having explored these constructions from a purely model-building point of view, we concluded by considering them within a decision-making setting, by studying \emph{geometry-aware Bayesian optimization}.
There, saw that using geometry-aware models also resulted in a modest performance improvement in cases where topology and geometry play a non-trivial role, particularly for higher dimensional spaces.

It is clear that our ideas apply within an even wider scope than what we have explored.
For example, our derivations for the Mat√©rn class apply essentially-unmodified to closely-related settings such as \emph{manifolds with boundary}, provided one introduces boundary conditions which ensure the operators of interest behave the same way as in our setting.
Extensions such as this make excellent candidates for future work.

Our differential-geometric framework also provides a promising way to study \emph{symmetry} within Gaussian processes and Bayesian optimization.
Since symmetry plays a fundamental role in geometry and in physics, understanding how to handle symmetries is a promising avenue for building richer classes of Gaussian process models, and applying techniques such as Bayesian optimization to wider classes of scientific problems.

We hope that techniques such as the ones presented here proivde a foundation upon which these and other developments can be built.
We therefore conclude our presentation of contributions, and move to discuss the state and overall picture of Gaussian processes and decision systems that we have studied.
